The structure of the class C ampC 3lactamABSTRACT
ase (cephalosporinase) from Enterobacter cloacae strain P99
has been established by x-ray crystallography to 2- resolution
and compared to a class A ,B-lactamase (penicillinase) structure. The binding site for .lactam antibiotics is generally more
open than that in penicillinases, in agreement with the ability
of the class C 3lactamases to better bind third-generation
cephalosporins. Four corresponding catalytic residues (Ser64/70, Lys-67/73, Lys-315/234, and Tyr-150/Ser-130 in
dass C/A) lie in equivalent positions within 0.4 . Significant
differences in positions and accessibilities of Arg-349/244 may
explain the inability of clavulanate-type inhibitors to effectively
inactivate the class C j-lactamases. Glu-166, required for
deacylation of the 3-lactamoyl intermediate in class A penicillinases, has no counterpart in this cephalosporinase; the nearest candidate, Asp-217, Is 10 A from the reactive Ser-64. A
comparison of overall tertary folding shows that the cephalosporinase, more than the penicillinase, is broadly similar to the
ancestral 3lactam-inhibited enzymes of bacterial cell wall
synthesis. On this basis, it is proposed that the cephalosporinase is the older of the two 3lactamases, and, therefore, that
a local refolding in the active site, rather than a simple point
mutation, was required for the primordial class C &3-lactamase
to evolve to the dass A -lactamase having an improved ability
to catalyze the deacylation step of 3lactam hydrolysis.

Only since the late 1970s have the Enterobacter species
become resistant to ,B-lactam antibiotics (penicillins and
cephalosporins), so that now they are the third greatest cause
of Gram-negative nosocomial infections in the United States
(1). The primary cause of this resistance is the constitutive or
,B-lactam-inducible overproduction of 83-lactamase (EC
3.5.2.6), which catalyzes, via a serine-bound acyl intermediate, the hydrolysis of the ,B-lactam to an inactive acid:

cephalosporins such as cefotaxime, the clinical significance
of this class is growing rapidly (5). Their rather low catalytic
activity against these cephalosporins is offset by their high
overproduction. Especially troublesome is the class C 3-lactamase from the ampC gene of Enterobacter cloacae, as it is
only weakly inactivated by mechanism-based inhibitors such
as clavulanic acid, and it is expected to develop activity
against a currently effective carbapenem, imipenem (1).
To provide structural details for mechanistic proposals,
and hopefully for the design of inhibitors and new cephalosporins, we present here the crystal structure of the class C
3-lactamase from Ent. cloacae strain P99, with a comparison
of the class A and class C 3-lactamases at the levels of
polypeptide folding and active site architecture.
RESULTS
Crystallization and Data Collection. The ampC 3-lactamase
from Ent. cloacae strain P99 (6) was crystallized at room
temperature from 11% (vol/vol) polyethylene-glycol 8000 at
pH 6.5-8.5 in 50 mM sodium cacodylate buffer containing 1
mM MgCl2 and 1 mM NaN3. The crystals have space group
P21 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Cell dimensions are a = 46.50 A, b = 83.47 A, c = 95.46 A, and , =
90.00. Diffraction data (Table 1) were collected at room
temperature on a Siemens area x-ray detector with a Rigaku
12-kW rotating anode source with graphite-monochromatized Cu Ka radiation. Intensities were reduced and scaled
with the Xengen programs (7).
Structure Determination. The structure was solved by the
multiple isomorphous replacement method with the inclusion
of anomalous scattering (MIRAS). Protein phases calculated
from one heavy atom derivative were used to refine parameters of the other (35). With the mercury derivative contributing usefully only to 4.5-A resolution, the figure-of-merit for
13,749 reflections to 3-A resolution is 0.80. Fitting of maps
with the sequence of 361 residues (6) was done with FRODO
(8) on an Evans and Sutherland PS330 graphics system. The
two molecules of the asymmetric unit were traced and fitted
independently. Later, a map to 2-A resolution was calculated
with model-based phases and coefficients 2mFo DF, (9).
Structure Refinement. The 722-residue model was built by
using energy minimization and simulated annealing with
XPLOR (10). Refinement was done with the restrained leastsquares crystallographic program PROLSQ (11). The resulting
R factor for a model excluding water molecules and terminal
residues Thr-1 and Gln-361 is 0.217 for 41,710 reflections (F
- 3o-F) from 10.0- to 2.0-A resolution. Covalent bonds and
angles in the model deviate 0.018 A and 3.20 from ideal
values. Coordinate errors in the model are estimated (12) to
be 0.25 A. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit differ by

The 3-lactamases have been grouped into classes A through
D (2) or groups 1 through 4 (3). Most studied have been the
class A /-lactamases (group 2), whose members are commonly called penicillinases and use a non-classical serine
mechanism (4). The body of data on the class C enzymes, the
so-called cephalosporinases or group 1 /3-lactamases, is considerably smaller than that for class A. Because these 3-lactamases can destroy the once-dependable third-generation

75% sequence homology with the title enzyme, and a brief
report of its crystal structure has appeared (14). However, its
atomic coordinates are not available for a comparison.
Comparison with a Class A Penicillinase. The folding of this
39,200-Da class C cephalosporinase is compared in Fig. 1 B
and C with the folding of a class A penicillinase, the
29,500-Da 3-lactamase from Bacillus licheniformis (ref. 15,
Protein Data Bank ref. 4BLM). Four additional p,-strands in
the class C molecule (Fig. 2A) form a small antiparallel sheet
which is considerably twisted (60-90°) with respect to the
major five-stranded sheet common to both types of P-lactamase. For more detailed comparison of secondary structures, we use the unified nomenclature for penicillinrecognizing enzymes (16), in which the class A numbers are
expanded as necessary with letters a, b, c, . . . to denote
additional secondary structure elements not present in
smaller class A l3-lactamases. The result is seen in Fig. 2B,
where the spatial correspondence between the elements of
the two molecules is diagrammed, based on Fig. 1C.
An important difference between the tertiary structures of
the two types of f-lactamase occurs at the bottom of the
catalytic site in the vicinity of helix H7 (Fig. 3). This

a-helices and ,3-strands, respectively. (B) Spatial equivalence of secondary structure in the class C cephalosporinase (Upper) and class A

indicated by large rectangles, small rectangles, and dotted lines, respectively. Numbering for the smaller B. licheniformis enzyme is
discontinuous; the first residue in each element is numbered. The class C enzyme contains four major insertions in the minimal class A motif
at residues 120-150, 190-215, 264-277, and 290-310. Helices H10 run in opposite directions in the folded structures.

difference arises because the paths of the two polypeptide
chains diverge after the common B-strand B2b, with the class
C enzyme taking a much longer path from the rear of the
molecule to the catalytic site. Here, each chain forms a short
helix (H7) which contains an invariant acid residue, Glu-166
and Asp-217 in class A and C enzymes, respectively. The
chains come together again at 1-strand B2c. These two loops
are approximately related by a 1800 twist which places the
two acid residues in very different positions relative to the
three catalytic residues common to the two enzymes.

binding sites of class A (broken line) and class C (solid line)
/3-lactamases. The two loops at bottom are related by an approximately 1800 twist.

The 18-Lactam Binding Site. Between the a domain on the
left and the a/f8 domain on the right lies the site of ,B-lactam
binding (Fig. 4A), as observed in crystallographic studies of
1-lactam binding in 13-lactamases (14, 17-19) and in the
,B3lactam-inhibited Streptomyces R61 D-Ala-D-Ala-peptidase
(20). The reactive Ser-64 is at the N terminus of the H2 helix
and is adjacent to invariant Lys-67. A second conserved
lysine, Lys-315, lies on 1-strand B3 and is part of a signature
K(H)T(S)G tripeptide seen in all penicillin-recognizing enzymes (21, 22). Modeling of 1-lactam binding to 13-lactamases
(14, 23, 24) suggests that a /3-lactam substrate is likely to be
oriented with the carbonyl group of the /3lactam ring hydrogen-bonded in an oxyanion binding pocket between helix H2
(NH of Ser-64) and 3-strand B3 (NH of Ser-318). The variable
318 residue also supplies a carbonyl group to hydrogen bond
to the amide of the 1-lactam's acylamide linkage. Hydrogen
bonds are possible from the acylamide carbonyl group to the
amides of Gln-120 and Asn-152. The carboxylic acid group of
a dihydrothiazine ring of cephalosporins would lie near
Thr-316 and conserved Asn-346 from the C-terminal helix
Hil. R2 substituents on the ring would lie at the top of the
binding site near residues 287-289, which are hydrophilic in
all class C sequences. Significantly, a rather open space
exists at the bottom for R1 substituents.
Comparison of (3-Lactam Binding Sites in Class A and C
Enzymes. In Fig. 4 A and B it is seen that the three conserved
functionalities common to both classes, Ser-64/70 and Lys67/73 on helix H2 and Lys-315/234 on 13-strand B3, lie in
equivalent positions. Tyr-150 exists in the position occupied
by Ser-130 in class A enzymes. The functional atoms of the
four side chains are within 0.4 A of their counterpart on the
other enzyme; simple alteration of their crystallographic
conformation would put them even closer. Only the interresidue distance A is significantly different in the two active
sites. Two other residues with counterparts in class A enzymes are Gln-120 and Asn-152. As in the class A enzymes,
Asn-152 is strongly hydrogen bonded to Lys-67 on the H2
helix. It is significant that the residue required for deacylation

(4, 25, 26), Glu-166, is without

a coun-

terpart in this and other (14) class C ,B-lactamases. The
nearest acid residue, Asp-217, is 10 A away from Ser-64, and

its carboxylate group is directed away from Ser-64 (Fig. 3).
Asn-152 lies about 3 A from the virtual Glu-166 and 4.8 A
from Ser-64. Nor is there a counterpart for Asn-170, which is
thought to assist hydrolysis, albeit poorly, in class A mutants
lacking Glu-166 (18). On the right side of the binding site is a
buried arginine (Arg-349) conserved in the class C ,B-lactamases. The side chain is well stabilized by multiple interactions
with Ser-318 and Ser-343. This Arg-349 is unlikely to be the
counterpart of the class A Arg-244 (27-29), however, because
the two guanidinium groups are separated 4.5 A and the side
chains differ greatly in solvent accessibility (2.5 A3 vs. 24.5
A3 for Arg-244). It is more likely that nearby Asn-346 (Fig.
4A) is a hydrogen-bonding counterpart of Arg-244 and helps
to bind the carboxylic acid group of ,3-lactams.
Interaction with Clavulanic Acid Inhibitors of (-Lactamases.
Clavulanic acid irreversibly inactives most class A (3-lactamases, but it is generally ineffective in binding to and inhibiting
the class C f3lactamases (1, 30). In the class A enzymes, an
initial acylation by the reactive serine

is followed by protonation of the double bond, which leads to
opening of the oxazolidine ring followed by various rearrangements. From modeling, it has been proposed that the
protonation step is inadvertently enzyme catalyzed (31, 32).
A crystallographic water molecule, held by Arg-244, was said
to be the source of the proton necessary for oxazolidine ring
opening. For this class C ,B-lactamase, acylation is probably
very slow (30). Nevertheless, once acylation is achieved, a
similar modeling of the acylated intermediate (Fig. 5) shows
that Arg-349 is too distant for interaction with the clavulanate
carboxylic acid group. Instead, the clavulanate acid group
hydrogen bonds to Asn-346 and also to a water molecule
(Wll). Unlike the water molecule in the class A case, Wll is
distant from the nascent carbanion in the double bond of the

intermediate, and it is unlikely to provide a proton for the
ring-opening step. Thus, the inefficiency of the clavulanate
inactivation process appears to rest both on the low acylation
rate and on a deficient protonation of the double bond.

DISCUSSION
This comparison of the topology and catalytic geometry of
two distantly related /-lactamases has shown broad anatomical similarities but also localized differences in folding which
confer catalytic uniqueness to each enzyme. When the active
site of the class C Ent. cloacae ,B-lactamase is overlaid with
that of a representative class A ,-lactamase, four residues
implicated in ,B-lactam binding or catalysis easily coincide.
All interresidue distances are equivalent except that between
the reactive Ser-64/70 and its adjacent Lys-67/73 on helix
H2. The longer Ser * * Lys separation in this class C enzyme
would reduce any influence of Lys-67 on the activation of
Ser-64 prior to acylation. For the class C C. freundii enzyme,
an acylation and deacylation mechanism was proposed (14)
which utilizes an anionic Tyr-150, activated by nearby Lys-67
and Lys-315. However, the rather long distances seen here
(>3 A) involving Tyr-150 and the very strong binding of
Lys-67 with Asn-152 (2.5 A), make questionable this role for
Tyr-150. Without a Glu-166 counterpart, perhaps hydrolytic
deacylation of the acyl intermediate is simply not enzymatically catalyzed in class C 3-lactamases.
Another residue in class A enzymes, a generally conserved
Arg-244 thought to assist substrate binding and turnover (27,
28), clearly does not have an exact counterpart in the class C
enzyme. In the class A 3-lactamases, this Arg-244 is adventitiously placed to assist the enzyme's inactivation by mechanism-based clavulanic acid inhibitors (31, 32). We find an
arginine (Arg-349) near the binding site, but it is improperly
oriented for strong hydrogen bonding to the ,B-lactam carboxylate group. A better positional counterpart of Arg-244,
Asn-346, might weakly bind the carboxylic acid groups of
,3lactam substrates and clavulanic acid. However, modeling
indicates that Asn-346 does not adequately position a water
molecule for interaction with the acylated clavulanate intermediate. It appears, therefore, that an enzymatic catalysis of
the protonation step of the clavulanate mechanism, as proposed for the clavulanate-sensitive class A enzymes, is
unlikely in this class C binding site.
The class A and C tertiary structures differ markedly at the
bottom of the binding site, where acylamide substituents of
,3lactams would lie. From an analysis of mutant class A
,-lactamases, Huletsky et al. (33) proposed how a displacement of the B3 p-strand, to produce a larger space at the
bottom of the binding site, helps account for the extended
activity of recent SHV- and TEM-type mutants toward
third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime. This class C ,B-lactamase, with its inherently larger
space near the bottom of the 3-strand, is already better
configured to interact with 3-lactams with rigid and branched
R1 substituents.
Comparison of &3lactamases with an ancestral penicillinsensitive D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase-transpeptidase (DDpeptidase) has been discussed in terms of function (34) and
secondary structure (16), and now a detailed comparison of
the three-dimensional structures of all three types of &3lactam-recognizing enzymes will be possible. Preliminary comparison reveals the folding of the class C ,3lactamase is much
closer to that of the parent DD-peptidase than is the folding
of the class A ,B-lactamase. This difference in folding now
becomes the basis for a conjecture that a catalytic general
base, the Glu-166 unique to the class A enzymes, had to arise
not by simple point mutation in the precursor class C enzyme
but by a local refolding (Fig. 3) which moved an existing acid

residue, perhaps Asp-217, to an optimal position to activate
a water molecule for a catalyzed deacylation of the acyl
intermediate. This mutational refolding produced a modified
,B-lactamase (class A) having the ability to hydrolytically
deacylate ,B3lactamoyl intermediates much more rapidly than
the primordial class C /3lactamase.
