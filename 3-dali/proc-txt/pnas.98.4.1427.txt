The cell wall imparts structural strength and shape to bacteria. It is
made up of polymeric glycan chains with peptide branches that are
cross-linked to form the cell wall. The cross-linking reaction, catalyzed by transpeptidases, is the last step in cell wall biosynthesis.
These enzymes are members of the family of penicillin-binding
proteins, the targets of ␤-lactam antibiotics. We report herein the
structure of a penicillin-binding protein complexed with a cephalosporin designed to probe the mechanism of the cross-linking
reaction catalyzed by transpeptidases. The 1.2-Å resolution x-ray
structure of this cephalosporin bound to the active site of the
bifunctional serine type D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase兾
transpeptidase (EC 3.4.16.4) from Streptomyces sp. strain R61
reveals how the two peptide strands from the polymeric substrates
are sequestered in the active site of a transpeptidase. The structure
of this complex provides a snapshot of the enzyme and the bound
cell wall components poised for the final and critical cross-linking
step of cell wall biosynthesis.

S

ince their clinical introduction more than 50 years ago,
␤-lactam antibiotics have been essential drugs in combating
bacterial infections. To date, ␤-lactams constitute approximately
60% of all clinically used antibiotics. These antibiotics interfere
with cell wall biosynthesis. All bacteria, with very few exceptions,
have a cross-linked cell wall (1, 2). The cross-linking takes place
as the last step in biosynthesis of cell wall, a reaction that is
catalyzed by bacterial transpeptidases (1, 3–6), enzymes that rely
on an active-site serine for their reactions. The activated serine
of transpeptidase attacks the carbonyl of the penultimate D-Ala
of the peptidoglycan precursor, with concomitant departure of
the terminal D-Ala, to give rise to an acyl-enzyme intermediate
(Fig. 1A). An amine from the side chain of another peptidoglycan (diaminopimelate, modified lysine, or ornithine derivative)
reacts with the ester of the acyl-enzyme intermediate to give the
cross-linked species.
It was suggested by Tipper and Strominger (7) that a ␤-lactam
antibiotic, such as a penicillin or a cephalosporin, mimics the
conformation of the acyl-D-Ala-D-Ala portion of the bacterial
peptidoglycan. It also was found that ␤-lactam antibiotics covalently modify the active-site serine of transpeptidase via the
␤-lactam carbonyl group, which spatially corresponds to the
carbonyl of the penultimate D-Ala of the pentapeptide. The
penicillin structure in its entirety remains tethered to the enzyme
as an integral part of the long-lived acyl-enzyme species, presenting a steric barrier to the approach of the second strand of
peptidoglycan at the ester carbonyl (8). With the active site
covalently modified by the antibiotic, the enzyme is no longer
available for its normal function, transpeptidation is prevented,
and bacterial death ensues.
We designed and synthesized cephalosporin 1, which incorporates components of the cell wall in its structure (Fig. 1B). We
envisioned that cephalosporin 1 would modify the active-site
serine of the transpeptidase, as would other ␤-lactams, by
mimicking the acyl-D-Ala-D-Ala portion of the peptidoglycan
(the portions of 1 in red in Fig. 1B). But, the portion to the right

of the acylated species with our cephalosporin (in green; complex 2, Fig. 1B) would mimic the approaching nucleophile,
diaminopimelate, from the second strand of the peptidoglycan.
Hence, cephalosporin 1 was expected to be an inhibitor of
transpeptidases, albeit a unique one with structural characteristics of the two strands of peptidoglycan. Complex 2 represents
a snapshot of the two peptidoglycan strands just before the
cross-linking reaction, when diaminopimelate from the second
strand approaches the ester of the acyl-enzyme intermediate
formed by the transpeptidase bound to the first strand of
peptidoglycan. Although there are some variations in the structures for the cross-links of peptidoglycans in different types of
bacteria, the structure of peptidoglycan that is incorporated into
cephalosporin 1 is seen for all Gram-negative bacteria and occurs
in many Gram-positive organisms (1). Therefore, the mechanistic conclusions drawn from complex 2 would be valid for the
majority of bacteria. We hasten to add that the two ‘‘strands of
peptidoglycan’’ would be tethered to each other in complex 2. It
turns out that this reduction in the degrees of freedom for the
two strands is absolutely necessary for the structure determination, in light of the fact that numerous attempts at binding
derivatives of peptidoglycan into the PBP active sites have so far
failed to reveal any structural information. We report herein the
synthesis of cephalosporin 1, the complex of a transpeptidase
modified by 1 and its mechanistic implications for the crosslinking of the bacterial cell wall.
Methods
The synthetic procedures for the preparation of cephalosporin 1
and each of the intermediates, and their characterization by
high-field 13C and 1H NMR, IR, and high-resolution mass
spectra can be found in the supplemental material and Tables 2
and 3, which are published on the PNAS web site, www.pnas.org.
All compounds containing the oxazolidine moiety exhibited two
sets or broadening of NMR signals at room temperature, due to
the presence of a dynamic equilibrium between two conformers
in solution in the absence of enzyme (9, 10). Additionally,
compounds with peptide chains attached to the cephalosporin
moiety also exhibited additional conformers. These conformational states were studied either by recording the spectra at
higher temperatures or by reducing the concentration to minimize such conformational states that may be induced in an
intermolecular set of interactions.

Initial refinement was carried out by using CNS (12). The
refined model was fitted to 2 Fo⫺Fc and Fo⫺Fc electron density
maps by using CHAIN (13). Several rounds of refinement and
fitting were performed. Solvent molecules, with reasonable
hydrogen bond distances and geometry, were added except in
the region of the ligand-binding site. The agreement between
the model of the complex and the diffraction data are measured by the R factor, which converged in CNS to 0.214. After
CNS refinement, SHELX-97 (14) was used to refine the molecule
anisotropically, which resulted in a 0.035 drop in Rfree, an
independent measure of the progress of the refinement. The
program O (15) was used to analyze and fit electron density
maps from SHELX-97. At this stage, the ligand and alternate
side-chain conformations were added. When the R factor
converged in SHELX-97, hydrogen atoms were added that
appeared as 3-␴ difference density peaks.

bacteria and some Gram-positives catalyzed by certain penicillin-binding
proteins (PBPs), beginning with acylation of the active-site serine of the
enzyme by the peptide of one strand of peptidoglycan (E denotes the
enzyme). Reaction of the second strand of the peptidoglycan with the ester
of the acyl-enzyme intermediate results in the cross-linked cell wall. (B) The

Cephalosporin 1 acylates the active site serine of the transpeptidase, as
would the peptide from the first strand of peptidoglycan, concomitant
with the departure of the terminal D-Ala. The ␤-lactam nitrogen and its
adjacent carbon and carboxylate collectively serve as a surrogate for the
departing D-Ala, and the same atoms constitute a portion of the incoming
DAP surrogate in strand 2 in complex 2. The acyl-enzyme species 2 depicts
the first enzyme-bound ‘‘peptidoglycan’’ strand (shown in red) poised to
receive the amine of DAP from the second strand of peptidoglycan (shown

minimizations and molecular dynamics simulations were performed by using the AMBER 5.0 suite of software (16, 17).
Graphical and molecular database analyses were performed by
using the SYBYL software (version 6.5, Tripos Associates, St.
Louis). For cephalosporin 1 and for all other residues, MNDO
electrostatic potential charges and standard AMBER parameter
set were used, respectively. Carbohydrate residues, Nacetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM), were
treated by using the GLYCAM force field parameter set (18). The
1.2-Å resolution crystal structure of the Streptomyces R61 PBP
complexed with the cephalosporin 1 was used for the starting
coordinates. Initially, the protein molecule and its crystallographic symmetry counterpart, including the crystallographic
water molecules, were solvated with 25,692 TIP3 waters and
subjected to energy minimization for 5,000 iterations. Subsequently, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on the
assembly at constant volume for 10 ps at 300 K in the time steps
of 2 fs by using periodic boundary conditions. The system was
then further equilibrated at constant pressure of 1 atm for 40 ps
at 300 K by using periodic boundary conditions with nonbonded
cut-off of 12 Å. After 50 ps, snapshots of the molecular dynamics
simulations were collected at every picosecond for up to 248 ps.
The average rms deviation of C␣ atoms was 1.28 ⫾ 0.18 Å.
Coordinates of the energy-minimized inhibitor in the presence
and absence of the symmetry-related protein molecule were
extracted and overlapped to compare the conformational
differences.
Results and Discussion
Compound 1 was synthesized according to Scheme 1. The key
intermediate 5 was obtained by a Stille coupling between
stannane 3 and trif late 4. Several other attempts, including the
Wittig reaction, Suzuki coupling, Heck coupling, and Zncatalyzed Reformatsky-type coupling, to form the COC bond
between cephalosporin derivatives and appropriate oxazolidines were not successful. Subsequent hydrogenation of 5 in
excess Pd兾C gave the alcohol 6. The isopropylidene moiety was
removed presumably by the slight acidity present in the
commercial Pd兾C. A two-step Dess-Martin兾Jones oxidation of
6 afforded the acid 8 in high yield. Compound 8 then was
coupled to the protected D-Ala-D-Ala 9 by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) to give
10. The Boc group of 10 was removed in the presence of
chlorotrimethylsilane (TMSCl)兾NaI. Another DCC coupling
of the resultant 11 with protected D-Glu yielded the desired 13.
Subsequent global deprotection of all of the acid-sensitive
protecting groups and conversion of the resultant carboxylic
acids into sodium salts gave the desired 1.

from Streptomyces sp. strain R61 readily, because incubation of
cephalosporin 1 and the enzyme in crystalline form gave a stable
acyl-enzyme species that was detectable by using x-ray crystallographic techniques. The position of cephalosporin 1 in the
active site was determined by fitting 1.2-Å difference electron
density maps. Statistics for the data collection and refinement
show that this is a well-determined structure (Table 1).
Fig. 2A shows the details of binding of cephalosporin 1 in the
active site pocket of the enzyme, for which a schematic is
presented in Fig. 2B. Cephalosporin 1 is bound between the
all-helical and the ␣兾␤ domains of the PBP. PBPs have three
signature sequences with eight conserved residues: Ser62–x–x–
Lys, which contains the catalytic serine residue; Ser兾Tyr159–x–
Asn, on a loop below the active site; and Lys兾His298–Thr–Gly–
Thr兾Ser, which occurs on the inner strand of the ␤-sheet that
flanks the active site. Both strands 1 and 2 of cephalosporin 1 are
oriented antiparallel to the inner ␤-strand of the antiparallel ␤
sheet of the enzyme. The catalytic serine residue is somewhat
buried in a pocket formed below the grooves on the surface of
the enzyme, where the bulk of the peptidoglycan analogs bind.
The strands are anchored by 11 hydrogen bonds in the acylated
enzyme species, five associated with strand 1 and six associated
with strand 2. Seven of these interactions involve residues that
are conserved in all known PBPs (see Fig. 2).
Several key features are revealed by the structure of the
complex. Serine-62 is positioned on a helix dipole, and it is likely
that the pKa of its side-chain hydroxyl is somewhat lowered. The
side chain of Lys-65 is in contact with the Ser-62 hydroxyl (3.04
Å) in the absence of any ligand and it is believed to activate it
for the enzyme acylation event (5, 8). The N␧ of the diaminopimelate (DAP) surrogate in the inhibitor is located on the
␤-side of the ␤-lactam, 2.6 Å from the carbonyl of the ester bond
linking the compound to the enzyme. This positioning is ideally
suited for the subsequent addition to the ester carbonyl that
would result in the natural cross-linked cell wall. Tyrosine-159,
assuming that its side chain is deprotonated, is the likely
active-site base positioned for activation of the incoming DAP
amine (at 4.0 Å) for the addition reaction. The DAP amine,

Tyr-159, and Lys-65 could function as a relay mechanism for
transfer of a proton from the incoming peptidoglycan to the
departing Ser-62.
Crystallographic studies have shown little change in the
enzyme structure on binding ␤-lactams. One exception is the side
chain of Thr-301, which rotates to hydrogen bond with a
side-chain nitrogen in bulky cephalosporins (8). This rotation
also is observed with cephalosporin 1. Interestingly, with cephalosporin 1 there is also an unusual rotation of the ␤-sheet
carbonyl of Thr-301, moving it 3.3 Å away from the active site.
This movement is no doubt necessary for steric reasons to allow
proper positioning of the peptidoglycan analog. The only other
shift of the enzyme to accommodate the ligand is a movement
of the side chain of Asn-161, which moves into a hydrogenbonding orientation, with N␦2 positioned 2.9 Å from the oxygen
of the C-7 side-chain amide of cephalosporin 1.
Crystal packing positions a second copy of the enzyme
molecule near the active site of the first, and three interactions
occur between the bound ligand and the symmetry-related copy
of the enzyme. One interaction is a strong hydrogen bond (2.7
Å) between oxygen of the side chain in D-Glu of cephalosporin
1 and the main-chain amide of Asp-98 on the symmetry-related
molecule. The other two contacts are at distances of 3.7 and 3.3
Å, representing weak interactions. The effect of this symmetryrelated copy of the enzyme on binding of cephalosporin 1 was
investigated by using molecular dynamics simulations. No difference in binding of cephalosporin 1 was observed with or
without the inclusion of the symmetry-related copy of the
enzyme molecule. Within the simulation period of 198 ps (after
equilibration), the inhibitor in both situations behaved similarly.
The average rms deviations of all of the atoms of the cephalosporin inhibitor in the presence and absence of the symmetryrelated enzyme molecule were 1.62 ⫾ 0.41 and 1.49 ⫾ 0.80 Å,
respectively. This shows that the movement of cephalosporin 1
after acylation of the active site serine residue is not influenced
by the inclusion of the symmetry-related enzyme molecule.
Therefore, the structure depicts a realistic conformation, unaffected by crystallographic packing.
In solving the structure of this complex, we were able to
consider the position of the polysaccharide portions of the cell
wall. We have extended the structures of the peptidoglycan
portions from the crystallographically determined positions for
cephalosporin 1 up to NAM–N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) res-

BIOCHEMISTRY

C ␤-lactamases are known to have descended from different
PBPs (5), so these independent evolutionary adaptations are
plausible. Furthermore, the surface of the transpeptidase that
interacts with peptidoglycan strand 1 (at six o’clock in Fig. 2C)
is entirely absent in the two classes of ␤-lactamases. Therefore,
␤-lactamases have lost the structural surface for binding to both
peptidoglycan strands, so as to be able to specialize exclusively
as enzymes of antibiotic resistance.
These structural studies show the positions of the peptidoglycan components poised for the cross-linking step of cell wall
biosynthesis, providing a unique glimpse of how this critical step
takes place in bacteria. These data, together with the extension
of the crystallographic structure to model the glycan positions,
provide valuable information to aid in the design of novel
antibacterials that would bind to these enzymic subsites.

idues of the peptidoglycan strands. Eight crystallographic water
molecules were removed in building the extensions onto the x-ray
structure of cephalosporin 1. The model of the crystallographic
structure with the NAG–NAM extensions was solvated and
energy-minimized by using the AMBER 5.0 package. Energy
minimization showed stable glycan strands aligned in welldefined grooves on the surface of the enzyme (Fig. 2C). These
hydrophilic grooves, which are 18 Å apart at the peptide
branching points in NAM, would accommodate the polymeric
backbone of the sugar residues in peptidoglycan. We note that
Pares et al. (19) built a model of the peptidoglycan into the active
site of their 3.5-Å resolution structure of the PBP2x from
Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although a direct comparison of their
model and ours is not entirely possible, it is clear that the putative
saccharide-binding grooves in that report do not agree with the
positioning developed in our work.
There is mechanistic and structural evidence that ␤-lactamases, enzymes that confer resistance to ␤-lactam antibiotics,
evolved from PBPs (5, 20, 21). The two classes of enzymes have
similar overall structural folds, yet neither can effectively catalyze the reaction of its kin. The structure of Fig. 2C reveals why
this is the case. The groove that accommodates peptidoglycan
strand 2 is obliterated by an insertion in ␤-lactamases (residues
214–224 and 285–296 in class A and class C ␤-lactamases,
respectively) at that site. It is interesting that the local folds for
the two peptide insertions are distinct in the two classes of
␤-lactamases. Hence, it would appear that nature adopted this
ploy on two separate occasions in evolution of ␤-lactamases to
prevent interactions with strand 2 of peptidoglycan. Class A and
