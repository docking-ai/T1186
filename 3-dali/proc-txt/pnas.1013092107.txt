Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen that causes nosocomial infections for which there are limited
treatment options. Penicillin-binding protein PBP3, a key therapeutic target, is an essential enzyme responsible for the final steps of
peptidoglycan synthesis and is covalently inactivated by β-lactam
antibiotics. Here we disclose the first high resolution cocrystal structures of the P. aeruginosa PBP3 with both novel and marketed β-lactams. These structures reveal a conformational rearrangement of
Tyr532 and Phe533 and a ligand-induced conformational change of
Tyr409 and Arg489. The well-known affinity of the monobactam
aztreonam for P. aeruginosa PBP3 is due to a distinct hydrophobic
aromatic wall composed of Tyr503, Tyr532, and Phe533 interacting
with the gem-dimethyl group. The structure of MC-1, a new siderophore-conjugated monocarbam complexed with PBP3 provides
molecular insights for lead optimization. Importantly, we have identified a novel conformation that is distinct to the high-molecularweight class B PBP subfamily, which is identifiable by common features such as a hydrophobic aromatic wall formed by Tyr503, Tyr532,
and Phe533 and the structural flexibility of Tyr409 flanked by two
glycine residues. This is also the first example of a siderophoreconjugated triazolone-linked monocarbam complexed with any
PBP. Energetic analysis of tightly and loosely held computed hydration sites indicates protein desolvation effects contribute significantly to PBP3 binding, and analysis of hydration site energies
allows rank ordering of the second-order acylation rate constants.
Taken together, these structural, biochemical, and computational
studies provide a molecular basis for recognition of P. aeruginosa
PBP3 and open avenues for future design of inhibitors of this class
of PBPs.

nfections caused by Gram-negative pathogens are a serious
threat to public health. Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii are emerging as
significant pathogens. Therapeutic options for their treatment
are limited, in part due to more focused efforts over recent years
to combat Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus
and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (1, 2). Simultaneously, the
emergence and spread of resistance mechanisms including β-lactamases have diminished the value of many marketed β-lactam
antibiotics. New Gram-negative antibiotics for the treatment of
nosocomial infections are urgently needed to tackle the high
morbidity and mortality rates associated with multidrug resistant
pathogens.
P. aeruginosa causes multiple types of infections including
pneumonia, bacteremia, and urinary tract, ear, skin, and soft
tissue infections. Current therapies for P. aeruginosa infections
include broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics, carbapenems such
as imipenem or meropenem, or a more Gram-negative selective
monobactam such as aztreonam (3). In addition to producing
β-lactamases, P. aeruginosa can exhibit or acquire additional re-

sistance mechanisms including reduction of outer membrane permeability, expression of efflux pumps, or by mutating the target
penicillin-binding proteins (4).
The macromolecular targets for β-lactam antibiotics are penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), membrane-associated periplasmic
enzymes that catalyze essential transpeptidase reactions involving
peptidoglycan, a major component of bacterial cell walls. At least
six PBPs of P. aeruginosa have been detected by their ability to
form covalent adducts with radiolabeled penicillin G (5). Based
on their structural features and enzyme activities, P. aeruginosa
PBPs are categorized into three classes. High-molecular-weight
class A PBPs (PBP1a and PBP1b) are bifunctional enzymes containing both transglycosylase and transpeptidase activities. Highmolecular-weight class B PBP, of which Pseudomonas PBP3 is a
member, possesses only transpeptidase activity. Low-molecularweight class C PBPs, including PBP4 and PBP5, are soluble proteins and act as DD carboxypeptidases. The high-molecular PBPs
are essential for cell growth and are validated and precedented
targets for β-lactam antibiotics (6). PBP3, encoded by the ftsI
gene, is the only known peptidoglycan synthase in E. coli and is
essential for cell division. PBP3 inhibition by a β-lactam and gene
deletion inhibit cell septation, resulting in filamentation (7). PBP2
from Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NgPBP2), is the only other known
PBP3 ortholog from a Gram-negative pathogen that has been
crystallized. It has two flexible loop regions that appear to block
entry of inhibitors into the active site, resulting in unsuccessful
soaking experiments despite numerous attempts to produce
NgPBP2-inhibitor complexes (8).
One approach to circumvent permeability-mediated resistance
of Gram-negative pathogens such as P. aeruginosa is to utilize the
siderophore-mediated iron acquisition system to effectively deliver drug molecules to the periplasmic space (9). Bacteria require
iron in order to survive, and the acquisition of iron depends on
the production, release, and active reuptake of iron-scavenging
molecules called siderophores. Our strategy relies on the incorporation of a hydroxypyridone moiety as a siderophore attached

in increased concentrations of drug in the periplasm (10).
To help elucidate the molecular mechanism of P. aeruginosa
PBP3 (PaPBP3) and its β-lactam recognition elements, we solved
multiple X-ray structures of a soluble form of PaPBP3. Highresolution structures of the apo and ceftazidime-bound forms
were obtained as well as complexes with meropenem, imipenem,
and aztreonam. Extensive medicinal chemistry efforts led to the
identification of MC-1, a siderophore-conjugated monocarbam
that utilizes a carbonylaminosulfonyl species for β-lactam activation, and which shows remarkable antipseudomonal activity both
in vitro and in vivo. The crystal structure of PaPBP3 complexed
with MC-1 at 1.64-Å resolution reveals a unique binding mode of
the siderophore. WaterMap analysis was carried out to evaluate
the correlation between protein desolvation energies and the
second-order acylation constants (k2 ∕K d ) during ligand binding.
A ligand-dependent water displacement effectiveness score (ϵi )
provides a unique measure that rank orders the second-order
acylation rate constants. Our biochemical, computational, and
structural results provide key insight into recognition elements
and avenues to advance the design of β-lactam inhibitors with improved efficiency of PBP3 interaction and effectiveness against
Gram-negative pathogens.

Induced-Fit-Conformational Changes of the PaPBP3 in Complex with
Ceftazidime. Ceftazidime, a third-generation cephalosporin, has

good in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa and is clinically effective and safe in treating many nosocomial bacterial infections.
Ceftazidime is composed of a β-lactam ring fused with a six-membered dihydrothiazine ring, a methyl pyridine at the C3 position, a
carboxylic acid group at the C4 position, and a bulky aminothiazole-containing side chain at the C7 position (Fig. 1B). The crystal structure of PaPBP3 in complex with ceftazidime at 1.74-Å
resolution clearly identifies ceftazidime covalently bound to
Ser294 and the rearrangement of the dihydrothiazine ring to form
an exocyclic methylene group at C3 position due to the departure

of the pyridine moiety (Fig. S2) (13). The carbonyl oxygen of the
covalent enzyme-ceftazidime ester is positioned into the oxyanion
hole and hydrogen bonds with the main chain amides of Ser294
and Thr487. The C4 carboxylic acid group is anchored by two
hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of Ser485 and Thr487
in the KSGT motif. The Lys297 in the conserved SXXK motif no
longer hydrogen-bonds to Ser294 and is positioned to interact
with SXN motif, residues Ser349 and Asn351 (Fig. 2A).
The bulky aminothiazole-containing group has extensive interactions with PaPBP3. The amide bond of the ceftazidime is
wedged between the Thr487 carbonyl backbone and the Asn351
side chain. The aminothiazole moiety is stabilized by hydrogen
bonds with the Glu291 side chain and Arg489 carbonyl backbone
and by hydrophobic interaction with Tyr409. Importantly, the
Tyr409 side chain blocking the aminothiazole binding site in the
absence of ligand is swung out toward the solvent-exposed surface
to avoid a steric clash upon ceftazidime binding. The Tyr409,
flanked by two highly flexible glycine residues, is also present in
high-molecular mass PBPs of subclass B3 from other Gramnegative bacteria including N. gonorrhoeae PBP2 and E. coli
PBP3, and similar conformational changes involving tyrosine
residues appear to occur upon the binding of aminothiazole
moieties (8, 14). In contrast, the aminothiazole moiety makes
relatively few direct interactions with β-lactamases and apparently adopts a different conformation in the binding site of low
molecular mass PBPs, suggesting different recognition mechanPNAS ∣ December 21, 2010 ∣

Overall Structures of PaPBP3. PaPBP3 has overall dimensions of
∼45 × 63 × 100 Å and consists of two domains, an N-terminal
nonpenicillin-binding domain and a C-terminal transpeptidase
(TP) domain (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal domain, resembling a
pair of sugar tongs, extends with long β-strands ∼45 Å in length,
which are unique to the high-molecular mass of PBPs of subclass
B3 (11). The four conserved motifs of the N-terminal domain are
located at the base of the sugar tongs and form important structural elements involved in interdomain interactions (Fig. S1).
The N-terminal domain of the high-molecular-weight PBPs is
required for the folding and stability of the C-terminal transpeptidase domain and has been suggested to provide recognition sites
for formation of the multiprotein complex responsible for cell
wall biosynthesis (12). The structure of the C-terminal domain
(residues 225–579) is similar to other TP domains of PBPs, carrying the classical signature of the penicilloyl serine transferase
superfamily. The active site including the nucleophilic Ser294
residue is located between two subdomains, the α-subdomain
and α/β-subdomain. The α-subdomain containing α2, α4–α6, and
α8 forms one side of the active site groove. A β-hairpin extension
connecting α2 and α4 is composed of four short β-strands (β2a,
β2b, β2c, and β2d) and forms two perpendicular antiparallel
β-sheets (β2a/β2d and β2b/β2c) at the top of the active site.
The α/β subdomain contains a central core of a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β3/β4/β5/β1/β2) sandwiched by several helices on
both sides (α1, α9, α10, and α11). In all six PaPBP3 structures, the
two loop regions (residues 332–338 connecting β2c to β2d and
residues 526–533 connecting α5 to α11) display substantial conformational changes upon binding different inhibitor classes and
play an important role in substrate/inhibitor recognition.

isms for the aminothiazole moieties among different classes of
PBPs and β-lactamases (15, 16).
Unexpectedly, Tyr532 and Phe533 adopt a completely different
conformation upon ceftazidime binding, displacing the Tyr503
side chain toward the active site. These changes result in a unique
aromatic wall composed of Tyr503, Tyr532, and Phe533 that
accommodates the bulky gem-dimethyl group appended from the
oxime by a hydrophobic interaction. The aromatic wall is further
stabilized by forming a bridge with Val333, describing the boundary of the pocket for the gem-dimethyl group. Notably, upon ceftazidime binding, Val333 shifts by approximately 1.5 Å away from
the active site, not only to interact with the gem-dimethyl group
but also to allow van der Waals interaction with the six-membered
dihydrothiazine ring in the active site (Fig. 2B). In addition, the
carboxylic acid group forms a salt bridge with the guanidium
group of Arg489. The key features of the aromatic wall, together
with Val333 and Arg489, are likely to play a role in the efficient
inhibition of PaPBP3.

penem and meropenem possess a broad antibacterial spectrum
and are used primarily to combat penicillin- and cephalosporinresistant bacteria (17, 18). The electron density within the active
site revealed each carbapenem molecule covalently bound to
Ser294 (Fig. S2). Unlike the aminothiazole-containing ceftazidime complex, the Tyr409 side chain remains hydrogen-bonded
to the Thr487 carbonyl backbone, where the Thr487 side chain
is not close enough to make a direct hydrogen-bond interaction
with the C3 carboxylic acid group. Instead, the C3 carboxylic acid
is anchored by a water-mediated hydrogen bond with Thr487.
In both the imipenem and meropenem complex structures, the formation of the complex was accompanied by substantial conformational change in the regions of β3, β4 and the loop connecting β5
and α11 at the mouth of the active site. The Cα atoms of Tyr532 and
Phe533 in the imipenem complex were displaced 7.1 Å and 4.3 Å,
respectively, toward the opening of the active site pocket compared to their positions in the apo structure (Fig. 2C). A simultaneous reorientation of Tyr503 and Arg489 results in formation of a
stacking interaction with Tyr409. As a result, the hydrophobic pyrrolidine core of imipenem is completely buried by a hydrophobic
pocket formed by residues Val333 and Tyr532.
Surprisingly, the additional methyl group of the pyrrolidine
core in meropenem triggers a 180° flip of the Tyr532 side chain
and moves its side chain away from the active site to interact with
the Asn242 carbonyl backbone (Fig. 2D). Phe533 moves toward
the active site forming a tunnel-like hydrophobic pillar with
Val333 to stabilize the methyl group of the pyrrolidine core. The
carbamoyl pyrrolidinyl group of meropenem is further stabilized
by water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the Ile347 and Gly535
backbone. In contrast, in the imipenem complex structure, the
electron density beyond the thioether sulfur atom is weak and
discontinuous, suggesting that the C-2 side chain is not only flexible but also does not form strong interactions with PaPBP3.
Furthermore, a competition assay using a labeled penicillin G
shows that imipenem competes 16-fold less efficiently than
meropenem for inactivation of PBP3 by a fluorescent penicillin
analog (Table 1). Although the PaPBP3 crystal structures in
complex with carbapenems are products of inactivation reactions,
the hydrophobic interactions involving two different residues,
Tyr532 and Phe533, and additional water-mediated hydrogen
bonds likely play an important role in carbapenem recognition
and positioning for acylation of Ser 294.
The Efficient Binding of Monobactam Aztreonam to PaPBP3. The
monobactam aztreonam possesses very high affinity for PBP3
from a wide range of aerobic Gram-negative bacteria including
P. aeruginosa, but is inactive against Gram-positive bacteria due
to poor interaction with their essential PBPs (19). The structure
activity relationship of monobactams suggests that the 2-aminothiazole moiety of aztreonam contributes to the activity against
Gram-negative bacteria, and anti-Pseudomonal activity is enhanced by the addition of an iminopropyl carboxyl moiety. The
sulfonic acid group attached to the nitrogen of the β-lactam ring
is responsible for β-lactam activation, and methylation at the C4
position provides enhanced stability of the ring to β-lactamase
attack (20). The crystal structure of PaPBP3 in complex with aztreonam reveals that the bulky aminothiazole-containing moiety
is in a similar position to that adopted in the ceftazidime complex,
and the same induced-fit-conformational changes occur involving
residues Tyr409, Arg489, and the aromatic wall composed of
Tyr503, Tyr532, and Phe533 (Fig. 3A). β-lactam structural differences ranging from an unfused ring in aztreonam, to a five-membered fused ring in the carbapenems, or six-membered fused ring
in ceftazidime, do not affect the hydrophobic interaction with
Val333. The C4 methyl group of aztreonam does hinder rotation
in the ring-open form and is stabilized by the hydrophobic patch

The monocarbams are monocyclic β-lactam antibacterial agents
that have a carbonylaminosulfonyl activating group at the N-1
position. Significant efforts have been devoted to the modification
of β-lactams by incorporating a siderophore moiety to promote
uptake by Gram-negative bacteria by exploiting the siderophore
active transport system (21, 22). MC-1 is a siderophore-conjugated
monocarbam with a carbonylaminosulfonyl activating group at
N-1 position and a hydroxypyridone siderophore connected by
a triazolone-derived linker (Fig. 1B). Compared to aztreonam,
MC-1 was found to have exquisite potency against P. aeruginosa
clinical isolates with a MIC90 of 0.5 μg∕mL (Table 1).
In the cocrystal structure of PaPBP3 with MC-1 at 1.64-Å resolution, the hydrophobic pillar composed of Val333 and Phe533
bisects the active site cleft opening with the iminopropyl carboxyl
moiety on one side and the hydroxypyridone with triazolone linker
on the opposite side (Fig. 3 B and C). The bulky aminothiazolecontaining moiety displaces the Tyr409 side chain and induces
similar conformational changes as seen in the ceftazidime- and
aztreonam-bound structures. The gem-dimethyl group is stabilized by a hydrophobic interaction with residue Val333 and the
aromatic wall composed of Tyr503, Tyr532, and Phe533. The carboxylic acid group forms salt bridges with Arg489. Notably, the
triazolone linker adopts two alternative conformations in a perpendicular orientation, which allows the triazolone carbonyl
group to interact either with Gly535 backbone or with Leu346
and Lys484 via a water molecule. The hydroxypyridone sidero-

Solvent Rearrangement Effects and Second-Order Acylation Rate
Constants. A detailed molecular understanding of interactions

between proteins and ligands involves many factors (23). Barriers
to ligand binding and dissociation can arise from solvent rearrangement effects that can be rate determining when solvent transfer
to and from the binding site is critical (24). A consequence of this
for covalent inhibitors is that the second-order acylation rate constants, which are indicative of the efficiency of the ligand to inactivate the target, may be predicted by the protein desolvation
effects that occur during ligand binding. This assumes that the energetics of covalent bond formation and protein conformational
effects do not significantly change the rank ordering of the ligands.

phore is oriented toward the solvent-exposed surface and involved
in van der Waals interaction with Val333 and Phe533.
Unlike the sulfonic acid group directly attached to the N-1 position of the β-lactam ring in aztreonam, the MC-1 has a longer
carbonylaminosulfonyl species for activation. The additional carbonylamino moiety pushes the sulfonyl group outside the active
site by 1.3 Å. As a result, the sulfonyl group in the MC-1 acyl-enzyme structure forms two hydrogen bonds with backbone amides
of Gly534 and Gly535, effectively stabilizing a helix dipole at the
N-terminal end of the α11 helix. Interestingly, the α11 helix contains a proline residue (Pro540) that kinks the N-terminal end of
helix α11 toward the active site and helps the Phe533-containing
loop forming one side of active site cleft. Mutation of the equivalent Pro540 to serine in N. gonorrhoeae PBP2 leads to a decrease in
acylation rate despite no discernible effect on the structure of the
α11 helix (8). Importantly, in the MC-1 acyl-enzyme, the additional carbonylaminosulfonyl moiety forms an extensive hydrogen-bond network with conserved residues. The Ser349 of the
SXN motif forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of
sulfonyl cabonylamino moiety, whereas Thr487, the fourth residue of the conserved KT/SGS/T motif, forms bidentate hydrogen
bonds with the nitrogen atom and the other sulfonyl oxygen atom.

group is tightly anchored by side chains of Lys484, Ser485, and
Thr487. Although the lactam cores of aztreonam and ceftazidime
are quite distinct, the bulky aminothiazole-containing group plays
an important role in inducing conformational changes critical for
efficient interaction with P. aeruginosa PBP3.

A computational approach, called WaterMap, computes the
thermodynamic profile and free energies of hydration sites in
a protein active site relative to bulk solvent and has been successfully applied in other systems such as peptides binding to PDZ
domains, kinase selectivity, and ranking of congeneric molecules
binding to factor Xa (25–28). The approximation of free energy is
based exclusively on the displacement of water molecules within
the site upon binding of the ligand and ignores other terms such
as protein–ligand van der Waals contacts, electrostatic interactions, internal strain (ligand and protein), protein conformational
effects, and entropy changes. WaterMap energies also allow the
categorization and classification of the computed hydration sites
into stable and unstable waters based on the thermodynamic profile of each computed water cluster. As ligand binding involves
the exchange of protein–water for protein-ligand contacts, the
dissection of the thermodynamics of hydration sites could provide
insights into ligand binding and thereby the efficiency of PBP3
inactivation by siderophore-conjugated monocarbams (24).
Hydration sites were categorized into two different types of
waters—stable (ΔG < 0 kcal∕mol) and unstable (ΔG > 0 kcal∕
mol). Protein desolvation energies for each type of water site were
calculated for each ligand based on the respective crystal structures (Table 1). A normalization process, in which the ligandaffected total free energy of hydration sites (ΔGi u;s ) was divided
by the number of ligand-affected hydration sites (N i u;s ), standardizes this measure for any size effect of the ligand. This yields two
protein desolvation efficiency indices: an unstable water displacement efficiency index hΔGi u i and a stable water displacement
efficiency index hΔGi s i. A composite water displacement effectiveness score (ϵi ) is obtained by taking the ratio of hΔGi s i over
hΔGi u i. Both imipenem and meropenem binding do not involve
induced conformational changes of Tyr409 relative to the apo form
and displace stable hydration sites (ΔG < 0) to varying degrees.
Meropenem displaces 10 stable hydration sites, whereas imipenem
displaces only 2 stable hydration sites. Both these compounds displace similar numbers of unstable hydration sites (ΔG > 0). In
addition to the solvent rearrangement effects, imipenem and
meropenem induce significant protein conformational changes in
Tyr532 and Phe533 that were observed in the covalent-adduct formation (vide supra). In contrast, ceftazidime, MC-1, and aztreonam displace a significant number of unstable hydration sites
(Fig. 4) and their unstable water displacement efficiency index
ranges from 0.90 to 1.27 compared to 0.59 to 0.67 for imipenem
and meropenem. MC-1 and ceftazidime effectively displace a
greater number of unstable hydration sites than other β-lactams,
whereas aztreonam and MC-1 effectively displace a greater number of stable hydration sites. A plot between logðk2 ∕K d Þ and (ϵi )
indicates a reasonable trend between second-order acylation constants and water displacement effectiveness scores (Table 1 and
Fig. S3).
For a simple one-step binding process where covalent bond
formation is rapid, the rate-determining step is the formation
of the encounter complex: a complicated process involving protein–ligand recognition, protein conformational changes, and
desolvation effects. Depending on the compound and the binding
event, the slowest, rate-determining step can be defined by one
of the many effects indicated above. It is interesting to note that
despite the diversity of scaffolds involved in the core β-lactam of
these five ligands and the various protein conformational changes
observed, the composite water displacement effectiveness score
(ϵi ) rank orders the five ligands according to their second-order
acylation constants (k2 ∕K d ). This composite score balances two
types of desolvation energies—unstable water displacement efficiency index hΔGi u i, which provides an indication of the boost
that is obtained by displacing loosely held waters that need not
be a specific recognition element, and the stable water displacement efficiency index hΔGi s i that captures specific pharmacophoric recognition elements by displacing tightly held waters. The

index (ϵi ) appears to provide a measure of how effectively the
ligand binds in the initial interaction complex formed before
the covalent bond formation, which is exclusively based on protein desolvation energies.
Compounds that have more positive hΔGi u i tend to stabilize
the covalent–adduct complex, as measured by thermal stabilization assay (Table 1), whereas compounds that do not stabilize
the covalent-adduct complex relative to the apo form have lower
hΔGi u i. On the other hand, the stable waters are critical for appropriate recognition of key functionalities in the protein. Hence
the displacement of these waters with polar functional groups is
critical for both recognition and biological activity values. Compounds that have good submicromolar EC50 values all appear to
be replacing stable waters to a significant extent and have more
negative hΔGi s i. Despite its small size, aztreonam binds efficiently
by replacing most of the stable waters it is able to access with polar
functionalities and has the most negative hΔGi s i and the most
potent EC50 value. Significant thermal stabilization is also gained
from the covalent-adduct formation (in addition to the solvent
rearrangement effects), and the thermodynamics of covalent bond
formation are not discussed here.
In conclusion, the unique conformation of PaPBP3 with β-lactam inhibitors represents a distinct high-molecular-weight class B
PBP subfamily identifiable by the common features of the aromatic wall formed by Tyr503, Tyr532, and Phe533 and the structural flexibility of Tyr409 flanked by two glycine residues. The
guanidium group of Arg 489 shows a specific interaction with
the acid moiety of the inhibitors. This is the first structure of
a siderophore-conjugated triazolone-linked monocarbam complexed with PBP and provides molecular insights into the efficient
interaction of siderophore-conjugated monocarbams with the
important therapeutic target PBP3. The analysis of energetics
and rearrangement of waters suggests that protein desolvation
effects contribute to PBP3 binding, and the water displacement
effectiveness score (ϵi ) is indicative of the second-order acylation
constants. Our structural, biochemical, and computational studies
provide a molecular basis for understanding the coupled activity
and recognition specificity for P. aeruginosa PBP3 and for design of
inhibitors of this class of compounds.

Rapid Quench Flow Experiment. Acylation rates of PaPBP3 and βlactam antibiotics were determined using a RQF-3 Rapid Quench
Flow instrument (Kintek), as discussed in detail previously (29).

Table S1. The structure of apo-PaPBP3 was solved by molecular
replacement methods with the CCP4 version of PHASER (31),
using Neisseria gonorrhoeae PBP2 [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID
code 3EQU] as a search model. After molecular replacement,
maximum likelihood-based refinement of the atomic position
and temperature factors were performed with REFMAC (32)
and autoBUSTER (33), and the atomic model was built with
the program COOT (34). The refined PaPBP3-apo structure
was then used as a starting model for all other complexes. The
stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed by PROCHECK (35). Crystallographic statistics for the final models are
shown in Table 1. Figures were prepared with PYMOL (36).
