␤-Lactamases are the resistance enzymes for ␤-lactam antibiotics,
of which four classes are known. ␤-lactamases hydrolyze the
␤-lactam moieties of these antibiotics, rendering them inactive. It
is shown herein that the class D OXA-10 ␤-lactamase depends
critically on an unusual carbamylated lysine as the basic residue for
both the enzyme acylation and deacylation steps of catalysis. The
formation of carbamylated lysine is reversible. Evidence is presented that this enzyme is dimeric and carbamylated in living
bacteria. High-resolution x-ray structures for the native enzyme
were determined at pH values of 6.0, 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5. Two dimers
are present per asymmetric unit. One monomer in each dimer was
carbamylated at pH 6.0, whereas all four monomers were fully
carbamylated at pH 8.5. At the intermediate pH values, one
monomer of each dimer was carbamylated, and the other showed
a mixture of carbamylated and non-carbamylated lysines. It would
appear that, as the pH increased for the sample, additional lysines
were ‘‘titrated’’ by carbamylation. A handful of carbamylated
lysines are known from protein crystallographic data, all of which
have been attributed roles in structural stabilization (mostly as
metal ligands) of the proteins. This paper reports a previously
unrecognized role for a noncoordinated carbamylate lysine as a
basic residue involved in mechanistic reactions of an enzyme,
which indicates another means for expansion of the catalytic
capabilities of the amino acids in nature beyond the 20 common
amino acids in development of biological catalysts.

I

n the presence of compelling physiological needs, nature aptly
develops catalysts to meet the given requirement of the organism.
Such is clearly the case in evolution of determinants for resistance
to antibiotics (1, 2). The organisms that evolve or acquire such
mechanisms are capable of surviving the antibiotic challenge.
Among the multiple mechanisms for resistance to antibiotics that
nature has devised (1, 2), resistance enzymes for ␤-lactam antibiotics are the best understood. ␤-Lactamases catalyze hydrolysis of
the ␤-lactam moieties of these antibacterial agents; thereby, the
drug is made ineffective. Because of the extensive clinical use of
␤-lactam antibiotics over the past 50 years, a strong selection power
has favored organisms that harbor the genes for these resistance
enzymes. Over 340 distinct ␤-lactamases are known (3, 4) that fall
into four enzyme classes: A, B, C, and D. It is now accepted that
␤-lactamases have descended from a family of bacterial enzymes
referred to as penicillin-binding proteins (5, 6). Furthermore, each
class of ␤-lactamases has evolved from a distinct penicillin-binding
protein (6). It would appear that, in the course of these evolutionary
processes, four distinct catalytic machineries have developed (7–9).
Class B enzymes are zinc dependent, whereas the remaining
three classes have pursued an active-site-serine strategy. The enzymes of classes A, C, and D undergo acylation by the substrate at
a serine residue, and the acylated enzyme species undergoes
deacylation in the second step of the catalytic process. Although the
acylation event has been handed down from the parental penicillinbinding proteins and appears to be shared among these enzymes,
the mechanisms for deacylation are different for all three classes,
including factors such as the directions of the approach of the

hydrolytic water molecule, as well as the details of the catalytic
facilitation by the enzymes (3, 6, 7, 9).
Enzymes of class D are the least understood. The structural
information for these enzymes has emerged only recently (8,
10–12). A feature for the catalytic events of class D enzymes
appears to be the use of the same residues for both the enzyme
acylation and deacylation steps (8). Furthermore, the residue of
central importance for this enzyme appears to be a carbamylated
lysine. As will be discussed herein, carbamylated Lys-70 is the
basic residue that promotes the serine hydroxyl for the acylation
step. This carbamylated lysine is also in a suitable position to
activate the incoming hydrolytic water for the deacylation event.
Hence, class D enzymes enjoy symmetry in their catalytic events.
We provide evidence in this report that carbamylation of lysine
is indispensable for the activity of the OXA-10 class D ␤-lactamase, and that it provides a means for expansion of the catalytic
capabilities of the amino acids in proteins beyond the 20 common
amino acids in development of this biological catalyst.
Materials and Methods
Antibiotics and other reagents were purchased from Sigma,
unless otherwise stated. The growth medium was purchased
either from Difco or Fisher Scientific. The chromatography
media were from Bio-Rad Laboratories, and NaH13CO3 (99%
enriched) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories
(Cambridge, MA). NaH14CO3 was purchased from Amersham
Pharmacia. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was from GIBCO兾
BRL; E. coli DH5␣ and plasmid pET24a⫹ were from Novagen.
Isolation and Purification of the OXA-10 Wild-Type and Lys-70-Ala
Mutant ␤-Lactamases. The Lys-70-Ala mutant was generated by

using the QuickChange Site-Directed mutagenesis protocol
(Stratagene). Specifically, the oxa-10 gene in the pET24a⫹
vector (8) was amplified by using Turbo PfuI DNA polymerase
and two mutagenic primers: Lys70AlaD, CCAGCATCAATTTGCGATCCCCAACGC; and Lys70AlaR, GCGTTGGGGATCGCAAATGTTGATGCTGG. The PCR product was further treated with DpnI restriction enzyme to digest the
methylated DNA, and E. coli DH5␣ was transformed by plasmid
DNA. The nucleotide sequence of the entire oxa gene was
verified, and E. coli BL21(DE3) was retransformed with it. Both
the wild-type and mutant ␤-lactamases were purified from the
growth medium and the periplasmic space according to a
published protocol (8). We followed the procedure of Neu and
Heppel in liberation of the periplasmic content (13).

The OXA-10
␤-lactamase (1.3 mg) was dialyzed against degassed 25 mM
sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5), and then against degassed 100
mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The solution was
supplemented with 20 mM NaH14CO3 with specific activity of 1.0
mCi兾mmol and was subjected to a Sephadex G-25 (1 ⫻ 20 cm)
desalting column preequilibrated with 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), under an atmosphere of argon. Elution
was performed with the same buffer. Aliquots of 1 ml were
collected, and radioactivity was measured. This experiment was
performed three times. The entire experiment was also carried
out with nonradioactive sodium bicarbonate (a total of four
times) to measure the protein yield and the activity after the
column.

M⫺1䡠cm⫺1). Kinetic parameters, kcat, Km, and kcat兾Km, were
determined from Lineweaver-Burk plot. Substrate concentrations were varied such that Km values were flanked by six data
points. In cases of biphasic turnover behavior, both phases were
characterized.

NMR Experiments. The OXA-10 ␤-lactamase (10 mg) was
dialyzed against several changes of degassed 25 mM sodium
acetate buffer (pH 4.5), and then against degassed 10 mM
sodium phosphate buffer, 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5). Finally, the
enzyme was dialyzed against the last buffer containing 10% D2O
and 20 mM NaH13CO3 and then concentrated to give a concentration of 1 mM. The 13C NMR spectrum of the OXA-10
␤-lactamase modified by 13C-labeled carbon dioxide was collected at 25°C. After determination of the 13C NMR spectrum
for the OXA-10 enzyme, the enzyme was dialyzed against 25 mM
sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5), followed by 10 mM sodium
phosphate buffer, 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5), and 10% D2O to
allow for the removal of the carbamate from the enzyme, and the
13C NMR spectrum was determined again. The Lys-70-Ala
mutant variant was treated similarly, and its 13C NMR spectrum
was determined at 25°C.

Determination of Carbon Dioxide Binding Constants. Unless other-

wise stated, all of the buffers were degassed under vacuum and were
subsequently purged by argon. The enzyme (2.9 ␮M, 100 ␮l) was
decarbamylated by incubation in 25 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH
4.5), under vacuum for 8–10 min. The activity of the enzyme (23
nM) was measured by monitoring hydrolysis of penicillin G (200
␮M) in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) in a total volume
of 500 ␮l. Carbon dioxide was provided by the addition of concentrated NaHCO3, prepared in the assay buffer. The carbon dioxide
concentration in solution was calculated as described before (14).
The ionic strength was kept constant at 0.3 M by the addition of
Na2SO4. Fitting of the results was carried out by the GRAFIT
software to a one-site-binding equation. Fluorometric measurements were performed in a Spex Industries (Metuchen, NJ) Fluoromax luminescence spectrophotometer to determine the binding
constant of carbon dioxide to the OXA-10 ␤-lactamase. The
protein was excited at 295 nm, and emission was recorded at 340
nm. The slit width was kept at 0.4 or 0.5 mm. Experiments were
carried out at 25°C in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5).
Aliquots of concentrated NaHCO3, prepared in the same buffer,
were added to the enzyme solution (2 ␮M) to provide the desired
carbon dioxide concentrations.
Kinetic Studies of the OXA-10 ␤-Lactamase. All kinetics measure-

ments were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array
spectrophotometer, at room temperature in 100 mM sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with and without supplements of
sodium bicarbonate. The enzyme concentration in the assays was
varied from 10 nM to 70 nM depending on the substrate.
Hydrolysis of the substrates was monitored at the corresponding
wavelengths: ampicillin at 240 nm (⌬␧ ⫽ 538 M⫺1䡠cm⫺1), carbenicillin at 240 nm (⌬␧ ⫽ 400 M⫺1䡠cm⫺1), penicillin G at 240

Golemi et al.

Dependence of Kinetic Parameters on pH. The pH dependence of the
hydrolytic activity of the OXA-10 ␤-lactamase for turnover of
penicillin G and nitrocefin (a chromogeneic cephalosporin that
undergoes monophasic turnover) was investigated. All assays were
performed at room temperature. The individual reactions were
buffered (pH range of 4.5 to 9.5) by a three-component buffer
system containing 50 mM acetic acid, 50 mM Mes, and 100 mM
Tris, which gave an ionic strength of 0.1 M (15).

OXA-10 and the Lys-70-Ala mutant ␤-lactamases (6 ␮M) were
recorded in a Jasco (Easton, MD) spectrophotometer at 25°C in
10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0).
Conformational Change of OXA-10 ␤-Lactamase. Experiments with

different concentrations of enzyme and substrates were performed. Oxacillin or cloxacillin (10 or 1.0 mM) was incubated
with the enzyme (2 or 0.5 ␮M) in a total volume of 100 ␮l,
respectively. Aliquots (2 ␮l or 8 ␮l) were removed and diluted
250-fold into a solution of 200 ␮M penicillin G in 100 mM
sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), at 1-min intervals up to 10 min. The
activity of the enzyme was measured by monitoring hydrolysis of
penicillin G immediately. We paid attention to the time when a
first-order recovery of activity was noted, which was seen after
4–6 min of incubation with the substrate.
Crystallization. Single crystals of the OXA-10 ␤-lactamase were

obtained by the hanging drop method as previously described
(10). Briefly, 1 ␮l of a protein solution at 10 mg兾ml in 20 mM
sodium potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) was mixed with 1
␮l of reservoir solution [2.0 M ammonium sulfate, either in 100
mM Tris䡠HCl (pH 8.5) or 100 mM Na兾Hepes (pH 7.5)] at 4°C.
Crystals of average size 300 ⫻ 300 ⫻ 50 ␮m (3) were obtained
after 2 weeks.
The influence of pH on carbamylation of Lys-70 in the protein
crystals was assessed in the following manner. The drop containing the crystals grown at pH 7.5 was transferred above a 1-ml
reservoir made of 2.2 M ammonium sulfate, 100 mM Na兾Mes,
at pH 6.0 or 6.5, and equilibration was allowed to proceed. With
volatile precipitating agents, such as ammonium sulfate, the pH
of the drop at equilibrium is determined by the pH of the
reservoir solution (16).
Protein-inhibitor complexes were prepared by a 5-min soaking
of the crystal grown at pH 7.5 in a solution of sodium 6␤hydroxyisopropylpenicillanate (125 mM), in ammonium sulfate
(2.2 M), 100 mM Na兾Hepes (pH 7.5). Crystals were cryoprotected by a 45-s immersion in the reservoir solution complemented with 20% (vol兾vol) ethylene glycol, before crycooling in
a gaseous nitrogen flux at 100 K.

Data Collection and Processing. Diffraction data were collected at

the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF; Grenoble,
France), at beamline ID14EH1 (native structures at pH 6.0, pH
6.5, and pH 7.5), beamline ID14 EH2 (inhibited enzyme derivative), or beamline BM30A (native structure at pH 8.5). Crystals
at all pH values were isomorphous with typical cell parameters
of a ⫽ 67.3 Å, b ⫽ 82.4 Å, c ⫽ 101.2 Å, and ␤ ⫽ 95.9°. Data were
processed with MOSF LM (17), scaled and merged with SCALA
(18), and converted to amplitudes with TRUNCATE, from the
CCP4 (19) suite of programs (Table 1). About 1,700–2,000
reflections from each data set were randomly extracted for the
calculation of the free R factor.

Refinement. The structure of the OXA-10 enzyme, refined to 1.8
Å (10), was used as a starting model for rigid-body refinement,
after removal of all solvent molecules and of the carbamyl group
on Lys-70. The sigmaA weighted electron density maps were
displayed with TURBO-FRODO. They clearly indicated the carbamylation and the acylation status of Lys-70 and Ser-67,
respectively, in each subunit of the two dimers in the asymmetric
unit. Carbamylated lysines and modified serines were introduced
accordingly at this stage. Further refinement was performed by
using the maximum likelihood method as implemented in
REFMAC (20), including a bulk solvent correction. In the last steps
of refinement, water molecules were introduced by using ARP
(21). Anisotropic B-factor refinement was applied in the last
refinement cycle except for the native structure at pH 6.0.

Results and Discussion
The x-ray crystal structure of the native OXA-10 ␤-lactamase at pH
8.5 indicated that Lys-70 in both subunits of the dimeric enzyme was
carbamylated (10). We presented an argument that the active site
environment around this lysine would appear to have evolved to
accommodate the carbamylated residue (10). For example, the side
chain of Lys-70 is sequestered in a hydrophobic environment within
the active site, created by five invariant residues. It is likely that this
hydrophobic environment would favor the free base form of the
lysine side chain, facilitating its carbamylation in the presence of
carbon dioxide. Furthermore, three specific electrostatic interactions stabilize the carbamate group on Lys-70 (10).

bamylation of the OXA-10 enzyme is reversible. The enzyme
that had been incubated with 25 mM NaHCO3 at pH 7.5 lost 50%
of its activity when run through a desalting Sephadex G-25
column. However, it regained full activity when replenished with
NaHCO3. In another experiment, the enzyme was incubated at
pH 4.5 to facilitate full decarbamylation. Then the pH was
adjusted to 7.5, and the solution was supplemented with radiolabeled NaHCO3 (25 mM). We found that the degree of
carbamylation of the enzyme by 14CO2 correlated with the same
degree of recovery of activity.
The enzyme after incubation at pH 4.5, followed by adjustment of the pH to 7.5 (in absence of bicarbonate supplement),
dramatically lost activity (12% remaining; Fig. 1). The gradual
increase in activity may be due to residual carbon dioxide in
solution, an observation noted with rubisco, an enzyme that has
a carbamylated lysine, indicating that traces of carbon dioxide
are difficult to eliminate in aqueous solution (22). As supplemental carbon dioxide is added to this protein solution, the
activity recovers fully (Fig. 1) with saturation (see Fig. 6, which
is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site,
www.pnas.org).
The presence of carbamylated enzyme was independently
documented by a 13C NMR experiment (Fig. 2). The OXA-10
␤-lactamase was decarbamylated at pH 4.5, the pH was adjusted
to 7.5, and the solution was subsequently incubated with 20 mM
13C-labeled sodium bicarbonate. The 13C NMR spectrum

showed the appearance of a signal at 164.0 ppm (Fig. 2 A),
corresponding to the carbamate residue, such as reported in the
literature for the enzyme rubisco (23) and for small molecule
carbamates (24). Other signals of significance were at 160.6 and
124.0 ppm (not shown), which correspond to the equilibrium
between bicarbonate and carbonate and to the free carbon
dioxide, respectively. When the labeled protein was incubated at
pH 4.5, followed by dialysis in degassed buffer at pH 7.5, the
signal at 164.0 ppm disappeared, consistent with the proposal for
reversible carbamylation of Lys-70 (data not shown).
We subsequently prepared the Lys-70-Ala mutant variant of
the OXA-10 enzyme. This enzyme is entirely inactive. Nitrocefin, the exceedingly reactive chromogeneic substrate, showed a
mere 0.05% turnover in the presence of the mutant protein (5
␮M protein and 100 ␮M nitrocefin). The extent of nitrocefin
turnover indicated the formation of product (0.05 ␮M) substantially below the concentration of the protein used. With other
more typical substrates such as penicillin G, we were not able to
detect any turnover. Circular dichroic spectra of the wild-type
enzyme and the Lys-70-Ala mutant variant were identical (data
not shown), so mutation at position Lys-70 did not alter the
secondary structural elements of the enzyme. The 13C NMR
(Fig. 2B) of this mutant enzyme, which is impaired for acylation,
indicated that the protein is not carbamylated (absence of the
164.0 ppm signal), as was expected.
Carbamylation of Lys-70 is reversible, as discussed above. We
have evaluated the dissociation constant for carbon dioxide by two
different methods. One method was based on activity assay and the
other on the inherent fluorescence property of the enzyme. The
activity-based measurement was carried out with penicillin G, and
the nature of the measurements was such that it had to be carried
out at nanomolar enzyme concentration (below the dimer兾
monomer dissociation constant of 1 ␮M). Hence, we measured a
dissociation constant (Kd) for carbon dioxide of 12.4 ⫾ 0.01 ␮M for
the monomeric OXA-10 ␤-lactamase. In light of the fact that the
active site has a tryptophan (Trp-154) at a distance of 3.0 Å from
the carbamate, carbamylation of the enzyme was expected to affect
the inherent fluorescence of the protein. A study by Chen and
Barkley has shown that carboxylates of glutamate or aspartate were
moderate quenchers of emission by tryptophan residues (25). We
carried out the fluorescence experiments at a micromolar concentration of the protein, above the monomer兾monomer dissociation
constant, because the fluorescence assay was insensitive at nanomolar concentration. The value for the dissociation constant for
carbon dioxide was evaluated at 0.23 ⫾ 0.05 ␮M. The Hill coefficient was close to unity and indicative of a lack of cooperativity in
the two carbamylation events within dimeric species. There is a
52-fold difference in these two dissociation constants, with the
dimer undergoing carbamylation more readily. In light of the fact
Golemi et al.

that the in vivo concentrations of carbon dioxide has been reported
to be 1.3 mM (26), the OXA-10 ␤-lactamase is expected to be fully
carbamylated in bacteria. We calculated the periplasmic concentration of the OXA-10 ␤-lactamase in two clinical strains of
Pseudomonas (source of OXA-10) to be 4–15 ␮M (see supporting
information). This concentration range is actually an underestimation, because we cannot expect that the procedure for liberation of
the enzyme from the periplasmic space would release 100% of the
enzyme contents for all bacteria. Regardless, the underestimation
of 4–15 ␮M gives a concentration minimum of at least 4-fold above
the dissociation constant for the dimer formation; hence, the
OXA-10 ␤-lactamase is a dimer in vivo.
Steady-State Kinetics. Because of the high activity of the enzyme,
kinetics experiments could be carried out only at nanomolar
concentrations of the enzyme. In these conditions, a typical feature
of turnover kinetics by a number of class D ␤-lactamases, including
the OXA-10 enzyme, is that they show at times biphasic properties.
Recently, two studies attributed the biphasic nature of the kinetics
to the dynamics of dimer兾monomer protein equilibrium (11, 27).
We, too, see biphasic kinetics for some substrates, but because we
carried our experiments at enzyme concentrations that are three
orders of magnitude below the dissociation constant for the dimer
formation, we cannot attribute the effects of such a dimer兾
monomer equilibrium to our observations.
The experiments with various substrates were carried out with
the purified native OXA-10 ␤-lactamase with and without supplementation of sodium bicarbonate as a source of carbon dioxide. In
light of our discussion above that the OXA-10 enzyme is fully
carbamylated in living bacteria, the results of the kinetic experiments in the presence of sodium bicarbonate are most relevant
(Table 2). Under these conditions, only oxacillin and cloxacillin
showed biphasic kinetic. As the results of Table 2 argue, the
OXA-10 enzyme is catalytically more competent in turnover of
penicillins, although it also turns over cephalosporins generally well.
In the absence of the supplemental bicarbonate, the OXA-10
enzyme exhibited biphasic turnover kinetics for ampicillin, carbenicillin, and cephaloridine. The data can be fitted to two
distinct turnover events, for which the parameters were evaluated (Table 2). On addition of bicarbonate, the kinetics simplified to monophasic, and the parameters for the monophasic
turnover kinetics approached very closely those of the first phase
of turnover kinetics in the absence of bicarbonate. It is important
to note that, in the case of the two phases, the effect is largely
on Km, which is increased for the second phase.
The occurrence of the second phase, at pH 7.0, with these
substrates may possibly arise from a decarbamylation event in
the course of catalysis that would lead to inactive enzyme species,
as described earlier. However, because the process of carbamyPNAS 兩 December 4, 2001 兩 vol. 98 兩 no. 25 兩 14283

lation is reversible, the active enzyme would be reconstituted by
carbamylation of Lys-70, to resume the catalytic process. This
hypothesis seems in line with our observations that biphasic
kinetics at pH of 5.0 and 7.0, with ampicillin as substrate, could
be fitted to monophasic kinetics at pH values of 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5
(data not shown). This observation would also argue for the
facility of carbamylation of Lys-70 at higher pH values for the
enzyme. Crystallographic evidence for this assertion will be
presented later in this manuscript.
We believe that the mechanistic basis for biphasic kinetics with
oxacillin and cloxacillin—which persisted despite supplementation
of bicarbonate—is more distinct than the possibility described
above for ampicillin, carbenicillin, and cephaloridine. These two
substrates have unusual sterically encumbered side chains at their
respective C6. On acylation of the active site serine, it would appear
that these substrates induce a conformational change in the protein,
which results in biphasic kinetics. The first phase is a burst before
the conformational change, which gives rise to the second and
slower phase for substrate turnover, which lasts until substrate
depletion. The evidence for this statement comes from the following experiment. Oxacillin was incubated with the OXA-10 enzyme,
and the enzyme was allowed to enter the second phase. An aliquot
of this mixture was diluted into a solution of penicillin G. One notes
a period of recovery of activity before the onset of steady-state
turnover of penicillin G, presumably corresponding to the recovery
of a conformation that allows for penicillin G hydrolysis. This
recovery takes place with closely similar first-order rate constants
of (1.0 ⫾ 0.3) ⫻ 10⫺3 s⫺1 and (0.8 ⫾ 0.4) ⫻ 10⫺3 s⫺1 with oxacillin
and cloxacillin, respectively. These values are substantially smaller
than the kcat values for these two substrates in the second phase

(Table 2), implying that the recovery of the initial conformational
state is slower than turnover. Hence, in the course of catalysis with
oxacillin, after deacylation, the enzyme experiences reacylation by
another substrate molecule and enters the catalytic process already
in the conformational state for the second phase, before the enzyme
has the opportunity to recover to the original conformational state
responsible for the first and more rapid phase of hydrolysis. In
addition to this type of conformational change, the possibility of
decarbamylation兾recarbamylation cannot be ruled out, but clearly
the process is more complicated with oxacillin and cloxacillin. It is
noteworthy that oxacillin and cloxacillin, because of their unusual
C6 side chains, have been shown to cause biphasic kinetics because
of such conformational change with other ␤-lactamases (28).
The pH dependence of the kinetic parameters for turnover of
penicillin G and nitrocefin were studied. The data fit a two-pK
model, with an acidic limb of 5.8–6.2 and a basic limb of 8.2–9.2
(see supporting information). These results are entirely consistent with the lower pKa describing the protonation state of
carbamate and the higher pKa defining the titration of the
second active site lysine, namely Lys-205. Therefore, for optimal
catalysis, carbamate should be unprotonated and Lys-205 needs
to be protonated. The low pKa value of 5.8 is consistent with the
pKa value of 5.2 that was reported for a small molecule carbamate in the literature (29).
Structures of Native Enzymes at Different pH Values. Data processing

and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The OXA-10
enzyme exists as a dimeric species, referred to in the text as the AC
and BD dimers found in the asymmetric unit. The structures of the
native enzyme were solved at four different pH values: 8.5 (1.80 Å),
7.5 (1.40 Å), 6.5 (1.70 Å) and 6.0 (1.90 Å). They revealed two
geometries of the active sites. Subunits A and B displayed identical
structures at all pH values whereas differences were seen for
subunits C and D, depending on the pH value. At pH 8.5, the
catalytic Lys-70 residue in all subunits was carbamylated (Fig. 3A).
One oxygen atom of the carbamyl groups is hydrogen bonded to the
hydroxyl group of Ser-67 (2.8 Å) and to the side chain nitrogen atom
of Trp-154 (3.0 Å). The second oxygen atom of the carbamate
group interacts with a buried water molecule (2.8 Å), itself hydrogen bonded to Asn-73OD1 (3.1 Å). The oxyanion hole is filled with
a water molecule located at 3.2 Å and 2.8 Å to the Ser-67 and
Phe-208 main chain nitrogen atoms, respectively. The hydroxyl
group of Ser-115 interacts with a water molecule (3.1 Å) and with
the amino group of Lys-205 (3.2 Å), homologous to Lys-234 in class
A enzymes. The other hydrogen bonding partner of Ser-115OG is
a sulfate anion (SUL1) anchored by a salt-bridge interaction to
Arg-250, homologous to Arg-244 in class A enzymes.
At pH 6.0, the active sites of monomers C and D displayed a
non-carbamylated Lys-70 (Fig. 2B) that goes with a major
alteration of the active site geometry. Instead of lying close to
Ser-67, the amino group of the side chain of Lys-70 moves away
from this catalytic residue, toward the main chain atoms of
Golemi et al.

as we indeed have observed from carbamylated crystals soaked with
gold cyanide (8, 10). The enzyme lost activity, and the structure
showed the non-carbamylated Lys-70 in the same location and
conformation to that seen in the structure of the OXA-10 enzyme
solved by Paetzel and colleagues (11) at pH 6.5 in the presence of
the chloride ion.
To underscore the critical need for carbamylation of Lys-70,
we observed that crystallized OXA-10 ␤-lactamase experienced
active site acylation by a ␤-lactam inhibitor only at the subunits
that were carbamylated (Fig. 3C). At pH 7.5, each subunit within
a given dimer (AC or BD) behaved differently. Monomers A and
B were carbamylated at Lys-70 and acylated at Ser-67, whereas
monomers C and D were not carbamylated and not acylated. In
these monomers, the conformation of the active site was similar
to what was observed in the native structures at pH 6.0.
We have shown in this manuscript that the class D OXA-10
␤-lactamase has evolved a distinct mechanism for its reaction
compared with other ␤-lactamases. This enzyme depends on a
critical carbamylated lysine in its active site for its catalytic
mechanism. The results reported herein argue for the fact that
disparate classes of ␤-lactamases have pursued different mechanisms to carry out the same reaction. The findings underscore
the independent evolution of this reaction from distinct ancestral
proteins in response to different selection factors (6).
The case of the OXA-10 ␤-lactamase is the first for the
involvement of a non-metal-coordinate carbamylated lysine as a
base in the active site of an enzyme. Carbamylated lysine may be
incorporated into proteins without the need for other enzymes
to create it posttranslationally. As such, it is a useful novel amino
acid that would expand the versatility of the side chains of amino
acids beyond the 20 common ones. It is in essence the structural
counterpart to arginine, except that its side chain is negatively
charged at the pH range useful for biological catalysts.

residues 111–114. The distance between the amino group of
Lys-70 and the hydroxyl group of Ser-67 increases from 2.8 Å to
4.6 Å. A water molecule binds in the space previously occupied
by the carbamate group, at hydrogen bond distance to the side
chain nitrogen atom of Trp-154 (3.3 Å) and to the water
molecule (3.3 Å) bound to the buried Asn-73OD1 (3.1 Å).
The displacement of the side chain of Lys-70 toward the main
chain atoms of residues 111–114, involves a motion of residues
114 to 119 away from the active site, and a 180° rotation of the
peptide bond between Val-144 and Ser-115. In these new
conformations, the amino group of the Lys-70 side chain interacts with the main chain oxygen atom of Val-114 (2.8 Å), and the
distance between the hydroxyl groups of Ser-115 and Ser-67
increases from 3.2 Å to 7.1 Å. A new sulfate ion (SUL2) binds
at hydrogen bond distance to the side chains of Ser-115 (2.6 Å),
Ser-67 (2.6 Å), and Lys-70 (2.8 Å). To accommodate the
displacement of residues 114–119, residues 92–104 move away
from the active site, as much as 3 Å for Trp-102 (Fig. 4).
At the intermediate pH values 6.5 and 7.5, monomers C and
D displayed two states and conformations of Lys-70, clearly
visible in the electron density maps. One of them corresponds to
a carbamylated lysine, and the other to a non-carbamylated
lysine. Their locations and environments were identical to those
previously described in the structures solved at pH 8.5 and 6.0,
respectively. Weak electron densities were found in the regions
92–104 and 114–119 because the simultaneous occurrence of the
conformations observed at pH 6.0 and 8.5 leads to overlapping
atomic positions.
Hence, comparing the structures of OXA-10 at four different pH
values, essentially two active site geometries are observed. Monomers A and B, at all pH values, and monomers C and D, at pH 8.5,
display a carbamylated Lys-70 residue located at close proximity to
the hydroxyl group of Ser-67. At pH 6.0, Lys-70 in monomers C and
D is not carbamylated, and the catalytic center (Ser-67, Lys-70, and
Ser-115) falls apart. This result also occurred in the OXA-13
enzyme, a close relative to OXA-10, which was crystallized at pH
5.5 (12). However, in both geometries, the electrostatic potential in
the vicinity of the Ser-67 hydroxyl group remains positive, binding
either the carbamate group on Lys-70 or a sulfate anion (SUL2).
This feature may be related to the inhibitory properties of anions
on the OXA-10 enzyme. Binding of these species in the active site
can, for electrostatic reasons, promote decarbamylation of Lys-70,
