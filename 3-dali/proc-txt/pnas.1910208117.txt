The three-dimensional (3D) crystal structures of the GAF3 domain
of cyanobacteriochrome Slr1393 (Synechocystis PCC6803) carrying
a phycocyanobilin chromophore could be solved in both 15-Z darkadapted state, Pr, λmax = 649 nm, and 15-E photoproduct, Pg,
λmax = 536 nm (resolution, 1.6 and 1.86 Å, respectively). The structural data allowed identifying the large spectral shift of the Pr-toPg conversion as resulting from an out-of-plane rotation of the
chromophore’s peripheral rings and an outward movement of a
short helix formed from a formerly unstructured loop. In addition, a third structure (2.1-Å resolution) starting from the photoproduct crystals allowed identification of elements that regulate
the absorption maxima. In this peculiar form, generated during
X-ray exposition, protein and chromophore conformation still resemble the photoproduct state, except for the D-ring already in
15-Z configuration and tilted out of plane akin the dark state.
Due to its formation from the photoproduct, it might be considered an early conformational change initiating the parental
state-recovering photocycle. The high quality and the distinct
features of the three forms allowed for applying quantumchemical calculations in the framework of multiscale modeling
to rationalize the absorption maxima changes. A systematic analysis
of the PCB chromophore in the presence and absence of the protein
environment showed that the direct electrostatic effect is negligible
on the spectral tuning. However, the protein forces the outer pyrrole rings of the chromophore to deviate from coplanarity, which is
identified as the dominating factor for the color regulation.

spectrum, even expanding into the near-ultraviolet range (1, 13, 14).
Therefore, CBCRs have been classified into several subfamilies
according to their absorbance range and amino acid sequence (3,
15). The most prevalent and best-studied subfamily is the red/green
switching one with a red-absorbing parental state (Pr, λmax around
650 nm) and a green-absorbing photoproduct (Pg, λmax around
540 nm) showing a remarkably large hypsochromic shift of
∼110 nm. This subfamily moved into the focus because their compact size and variable position of absorption bands approve them as
useful tools for optogenetics applications (12, 16). In addition,
CBCRs show a noticeable fluorescence for both photoswitchable
states, making them also applicable in superresolution microscopy
(17, 18). Various mechanisms of spectral tuning have been proposed, among others a steric hindrance that strongly distorts the
chromophore or a change in polarity in the chromophore-binding
Significance
Phytochromes and related photoreceptors distinguish themselves for their long-wavelength absorption and large spectral
shift between parental state and photoproduct. Both features
are not well understood, partly due to lack of high-resolution
structural data and insufficient support from quantumchemical calculations. The red–green switching cyanobacteriochrome Slr1393g3 shows an absorption shift larger than
110 nm. Both parental state and photoproduct could be crystallized with high resolution, together with a “hybrid” form
carrying the chromophore in parental state geometry, whereas
the protein remained in the photoproduct conformation. The
crystal structures reveal how chromophore and protein mutually regulate their conformational changes, yielding the observed spectral shift. Quantum-chemical calculations, based on
these structures, provide a deeper understanding of the spectral tuning mechanisms.

yanobacteriochromes (CBCRs) constitute a subgroup in the
bilin-binding protein superfamily of phytochromes (1–3).
These photoreceptors exhibit a remarkable photochromicity, in
case of the plant photoreceptors the absorption shifts by 65 nm
upon irradiation. The dark state is described as a red-absorbing
parental form (Pr) with λmax = 665 nm that is converted into a
far-red–absorbing photoproduct (Pfr) with λmax = 730 nm (4).
The light-driven conversion between the two states is common to
all phytochromes and is initiated by a site-specific photoisomerization of the double bond between the rings C and D of
the chromophore, converting the 15-Z isomer to the 15-E conformation (Fig. 1A, shown for CBCRs). The photoisomerization is
completed within a few picoseconds (5–8) and is followed by protein
motions expanding into the long milliseconds time range (9, 10). In
the “classical” phytochromes, a three-domain (PAS–GAF–PHY)
arrangement is essential to maintain the spectral and kinetic
properties. In this three-domain arrangement, the GAF domain
holds the chromophore through a covalent bond to a cysteine residue (Fig. 1 A and B) and other noncovalent interactions in the
binding pocket. CBCRs unite these properties—autocatalytic
chromophore binding and photochromicity—within a single GAF
domain even when expressed autonomously as a small protein
(19 kDa) (11, 12). Whereas canonical phytochromes switch between
a red- and a far-red–absorbing state, the absorbance maxima of
CBCRs (parental and photoproduct states) cover the entire visible

covalently to the protein via a thioether bond between Cys528 and the 31 position of PCB. The molecule is shown in the parental-state configuration

cavity upon protein conformational changes (18). However, a
solid support on the molecular level by, e.g., quantum-chemical
calculations underpinning either of these mechanisms, is still
missing.
Quantum-chemical calculations for phytochromes are challenging and sparse for two reasons: 1) the large size of the bilin
chromophore and 2) the lack of high-resolution structural information of the proteins. Regarding the latter aspect, in the red/
green switching subfamily, Narikawa et al. (19) have solved the
structure of the red form of AnPixJg2, and Lim et al. (20) have
recently obtained NMR-based data on both, the parental and
photoproduct forms for NpR6012g4. Overall, there are still very
few cases, in which both states of a phytochrome-related protein
have been structurally determined with resolution good enough
to serve as basis for precise quantum-chemical calculations. The
photosensory domain from the bacteriophytochrome of Deinococcus radiodurans has been crystallized in both states (21, 22)
with a resolution of nearly 1 Å for the parental state, although
with much lower resolution (>3 Å) for the photoproduct.
Structural information for both states of a phytochrome-related
photoreceptor was reported for the CBCR TePixJg from Thermosynechococcus elongatus (2.4 and 2.0 Å) (19, 23). However, in
contrast to canonical phytochromes and red/green switching
CBCRs, TePixJg shows a very blue-shifted parental state (λmax =
433 nm) and a green-absorbing photoproduct (λmax = 531 nm).
These short-wavelength absorptions of both states of TePixJg are
caused by atypical chromophores, a PCB-to-PVB (phycoviolobilin)
rearrangement (green-absorbing state), and the short absorption

maximum of the blue-absorbing parental state results from
covalent attachment of cysteine 494 to the central C10 position,
thus restricting the conjugated π-system to only two rings (C
and D) (13).
The scope of the present study is to close the gap between the
biological and photochemical studies by providing the highresolution crystal structures of both parental and photoproduct
states. These structures were analyzed by applying quantumchemical calculations in order to explain the spectral tuning in
the red/green CBCR subfamily. We have selected Slr1393 from
Synechocystis PCC6803 (λmax of Pr = 649 nm, λmax of Pg =
536 nm) (9, 17). The full-length protein is composed of three
successive GAF domains and a C-terminally located histidine
kinase, making it a member of the two component signaling
system (17). Out of the three GAF domains, only GAF3
(Slr1393g3) binds a bilin chromophore. This property and all
photochemical features are also preserved, if Slr1393g3 is
expressed independently as an autonomous protein (Fig. 1B) (9).
The absorption maxima of both states are sufficiently separated
to allow nearly complete photoconversion of one form into the
other, and the photoproduct shows a remarkable thermal stability (reconversion in the dark into the parental state by less
than 10% over 24 h, 20 °C) (9).
These properties allowed crystallization and structure determination in the parental and the photoproduct states of
Slr1393g3 with high resolution and therefore the identification of
conformational changes in the protein and in the chromophore.
The quality of the obtained structures encouraged us to apply

Crystallization of GAF3 Domain of Slr1393. Crystals of in vivo assembled Slr1393g3, i.e., PCB incorporation during biosynthesis
of the apoprotein (following a two-plasmid protocol; Methods) in
its parental (Pr) and photoproduct (Pg) states diffracted up to
1.8 and 1.86 Å, respectively. In addition, the apo-form of the
protein, assembled with PCB in vitro (i.e., after the immobilized
metal ion affinity chromatography [IMAC] purification step)
with PCB, was crystallized as Pr with 1.6-Å resolution (data
statistics and refinement in SI Appendix, Table S1). An additional structure was obtained with properties in-between the
parental and the photoproduct states (diffracted down to 2.1 Å)
carrying the chromophore already in the 15-Z conformation as
in the Pr state with an absorption around 640 nm, while the
protein still remains in the Pg conformation. We refer to this
structure as a hybrid form; besides both thermally stable
forms, calculations starting from this hybrid form were instrumental to understand the factors controlling the spectral
tuning.
Structure of the Red-Absorbing State (Pr State). Structures of the Pr
state of the in vivo- and the in vitro-assembled GAF3 domain
from Synechocystis (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID codes 5DFX
and 5DFY) are nearly identical (0.13 Å rmsd over 158 Cα atoms,
1 Å over all atoms). We refer to the in vitro structure in the
following, as its resolution is slightly higher. Crystals of the in
vitro-assembled Slr1393g3 diffracted to 1.6 Å and contained one
monomer per asymmetric unit (ASU). The entire sequence of
Slr1393g3 could be modeled into the electron density (residues
441 to 596, full-length numbering of Slr1393) with two
N-terminal residues originating from the expression tag (Gly439 to
Ser440). The R values after refinement were Rwork 15.5% and Rfree
18.1%, respectively.
Slr1393g3 shows a typical GAF domain folding with a central
twisted antiparallel β-sheet sandwiched by α-helices (Fig. 1B).
The overall fold is very similar to that from AnPixJg2 (PDB ID
code 3W2Z) (19) with 1.87 Å rmsd over 154 Cα atoms and also
to the GAF domain structure of the canonical phytochrome
Cph1 (PDB ID code 2VEA) with 1.98 Å rmsd over 142 Cα
atoms (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 A and B). In the following discussion, the names of canonical and bacterial phytochromes,
e.g., Cph1, refer to only their chromophore-binding GAF
domain.
The crystal structure of the parental state of AnPixJg2 (PDB
ID code 3W2Z) and the here-reported structure are the only
ones solved so far for members of the red/green-switching CBCR
subfamily. A significant difference between AnPixJg2 and
Slr1393g3 resides in the absence of β3 that is present as an unstructured loop in Slr1393g3. The α-helical element α4′ (Fig. 1 B
and D) is also found in the AnPixJg2 structure but was not annotated in the original work (19). The central β-sheet is composed of strands β1, β2, β4, β5, and β6, flanked by helices α3, α3′,
α4′, and α4 on the chromophore binding side, and α2 and α5 on
the opposite side; for details about secondary-structure elements
and amino acid annotation, see legend to Fig. 1. Two residues in
the Slr1393g3-Pr state interact with a symmetry-related molecule
in the crystal assembly (Lys487 with Asn511′ and Gln481 with
Glu550′ and Gln551′, respectively) (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A). The
PCB chromophore, covalently bound to Cys528 on helix α4, is
embedded in a cleft between the central β-sheet array and helices
α3, α3′, and α4 (Fig. 2). The protein surface charge around the
chromophore binding pocket shows an overall acidic character
probably facilitating attraction of the basic pyrrole rings of PCB

prior to covalent bond formation. Nevertheless, the chromophore is partially exposed to the solvent (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
PCB adopts the 15–16 Z-configuration, showing an overall
Z,Z,Z,s,s,a geometry for all double and single bonds in the ringconnecting bridges. The central rings B and C are in a nearly
planar arrangement but with strongly out-of-plane dihedral angles for the A–B and C–D ring methine bridges: 4=5–6-NB = 21°
and NC=14–15=16 = −156°. Following the nomenclature by
Rockwell et al. (13), the rings A and D have α-facial disposition
with respect to the plane determined by rings B and C. The Dring is kept in place mainly by aromatic amino acids (Tyr464, 3.7
Å; Phe474, 3.6 Å; Trp496, 3.4 Å; Thr543, 2.9 Å; Tyr559, 2.6 Å)
and forms an additional interaction through a hydrogen bond to
a water molecule (Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S4A).
Three residues play a key role in the incorporation of the
chromophore and are found to be conserved in the red–green
subfamily of CBCR: Cys528, His529, and Asp498 (Fig. 2A).
His529 is located in the α-position (above the chromophore
plane spanned by rings B and C; Fig. 2A) at a distance of 3.8 Å
(His atom Nδ to NB of PCB) and 3.5 Å (His atom Ne to NC of
PCB). The side chain of Asp498 comprises the central counterion interacting through its carboxylate group with the A-, B-, and
C-pyrrolic nitrogen atoms (2.6, 3.0, and 2.6 Å to nitrogen NA,
NB, and NC, respectively; Fig. 2A). This Asp counterion constellation is identical to AnPixJg2 and is different to phytochromes, e.g., Cph1, where the central position between pyrrole
nitrogens A, B, and C is occupied by the backbone carbonyl
group of an aspartate together with a water molecule. In
Slr1393g3-Pr state, the propionate group at ring B is backfolded,
making contact to Thr526 (2.8 Å) and to His529 (2.9 Å). The
propionate group of ring C instead is pointing away from the
pyrrole rings and interacts with Arg508 through the side chain as
well as through the backbone carbonyl unit in a range of 2.8 to
3.2 Å; the carboxylic group of this propionate makes additional
contacts to two closely located water molecules (Fig. 2A). The
carbonyl substituents at rings A and D are in hydrogen-bonding
distance to Asn532 and Trp496 (A-ring carbonyl group), and
Thr543 and Tyr559 (D-ring carbonyl group). In addition, a water
molecule is part of a hydrogen-bonding network between
His529 and the D-ring nitrogen (Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig.
S4A and Table S2). For a detailed comparison of chromophore–
protein interactions of Slr1393g3, see the two-dimensional (2D)
ligand plots in SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A–F (AnPixJg2, Cph1,
and TePixJg).
A tryptophan residue (here, Trp496) is proposed to stabilize
the Pr state of CBCRs. In Slr1393g3, the tryptophan side chain is
nearly parallel and in close π-stacking distance to ring D with
distances in the range 3.49 to 3.87 Å (Fig. 2 A and C and SI
Appendix, Fig. S4A). This residue undergoes the largest displacement upon Z–E isomerization (see below).
Structure of the Green-Absorbing Photoproduct State (Pg State). The
thermal stability of the photoproduct (Pg state) allowed crystallization and structure determination of Slr1393g3 in this
green-absorbing state. Crystals of the photoproduct state of the
in vivo-assembled Slr1393g3 diffracted to 1.86 Å with R values
after refinement of Rwork 19.3% and Rfree 23.0%, respectively,
and contain one monomer per ASU. The good quality of the
electron density clearly depicts the PCB chromophore in the
trans- (Z,Z,E,s,s,a) conformation.
In total, the secondary-structure elements and the overall
protein folding of the Pr state remain the same in the photoproduct structure (rmsd 2.43 Å over 155 Cα atoms). The most
significant change is the rearrangement of a long unstructured
loop yielding an outward movement of Trp496 (being in
π-stacking distance to ring D of the PCB molecule in the parental
state) and a displacement by ∼14 Å with respect to the side-chain
atom CZ2 (Fig. 2 B and C). This Trp outward movement opens

the chromophore binding pocket allowing water molecules to
enter (Figs. 2 and 3) (24). Part of this loop is rearranged into a
short (two-turn) additional α-helix (α2′, Leu486 to Asn492; Fig.
1D). This new α-helical element adds several hydrogen bonds to
this part of the protein and increases the stability of protein
conformation and chromophore in the photoproduct.
As a further consequence of the ring D rotation, the chromophore is drawn closer to helix α4 (Fig. 2D). It should be
mentioned that classical molecular dynamics and also NMR
experiments performed at ambient temperature on the Pr state
of AnPixJg2 revealed a subpopulation of Trp residues in a
“nonstacking” conformation (20, 25), suggesting that the unstructured loop carrying this Trp is prone to move already in the
parental state; however, the extent of this change might vary.
The Pg state of Slr1393g3 changes the propionate side chains’
counterion due to the chromophore movement (Fig. 2B):
Arg508 now forms a salt bridge with the propionate side chain of
ring B (photoproduct state) instead of that from ring C (parental
state) (SI Appendix, Table S2 and Fig. 2 A and B). The released
propionate group from ring C folds toward the chromophore and
interacts with His529 (2.7 Å). This change of interaction between
Arg508 and either of the two propionate side chains is caused by
the slight rotation of chromophore around its vertical axis. Interestingly, His529 engages both imidazole nitrogen atoms: Interactions are in hydrogen-bonding distance to B-ring propionate in
Pr through Nδ, whereas in Pg the interaction to C-ring propionate
now directs to Ne.
As a result of this spatial rearrangement, Thr526, Asn532,
Thr543, and Tyr559 no longer interact with the chromophore;
instead, Thr499 stabilizes the A-ring (3.1 Å), together with
Asp498 (2.74 Å), as also observed in Slr1393g3-Pr state (Fig. 2B
Xu et al.

and SI Appendix, Figs. S4B, S5A, and S6). An N-cyclohexyl-2hydroxyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid (CAPSO) molecule from
the precipitant is bound between two monomers close to the
propionate group of ring B (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 and Table S2)
interacting with Gln497 of one chain and Arg508 of the other
and further stabilizing the network (Fig. 2B and SI Appendix, Fig.
S4B). Four water molecules (2.64, 2.68, 2.71, and 2.76 Å) are in
hydrogen bonding distance to the oxygen atoms of the propionate groups of ring B and C, whereas only three are present in
the Pr state (Fig. 2 A and B). The D-ring experiences more
changes in the protein interaction: its carbonyl group has contact
to sodium 2 (Na2, 2.48 Å), and a water molecule formerly present in the parental state is now removed (Fig. 2B and SI Appendix, Fig. S4B).
The 15–16 double-bond isomerization of the PCB chromophore is associated with distortions along the single bonds between the four pyrrole rings that are larger than observed in the
parental state. The neighboring 14–15 single bond is highly
twisted (NC=14–15=16 = −109°) leading to an almost perpendicular D-ring with respect to the plane of the B and C rings.
Also the A-ring is more twisted away from the B–C plane (4=5–
6-NB = −61°). Hence, the twist of the single and double bond
contributes to the overall rotation of the peripheral rings relative
to the central rings. The tilting angle between rings A and B
changes from 30° in the α-facial disposition to 67° in the β-facial
disposition when going from dark state to the photoproduct. The
angle between rings C and D changes from 48° to 62°, both in the
α-facial disposition. Hence, the change of the tilt is more pronounced for the A ring than for the D ring even though the 15–
16 double has isomerized from Z to E conformation. This

observation raises the question which of the peripheral rings

Structure of a Hybrid Form of Slr1393g3. Under extended duration
of X-ray radiation at standard data collection conditions of the
photoproduct crystals described above, the chromophore, crystallized as Pg under red light, partly converted from its 15-E state
(photoproduct conformation) into the 15-Z state of the parental
form. The surrounding protein, however, remained in the photoproduct conformation (rmsd 0.45 Å over 157 Cα atoms; SI
Appendix, Fig. S4), with the features indicative for the photoproduct as described in the former paragraph. To exclude that
this hybrid conformation (henceforth Ph) is artificially resulting
from radiation damage, we carefully processed the data collection images in packages of 100 each and compared the data
statistics within these packages and with the whole processed
dataset. However, neither from data statistics nor from the
electron density (Fig. 3 and SI Appendix, Fig. S8) we observed
radiation damage [as was proven as a potentially occurring event
in structurally similar proteins by Li et al. (26)]. A comparison
between the chromophore configurations in all three structurally
solved states—Slr1393g3-Pr, Slr1393g3-Ph, and Slr1393g3-Pg—is
presented on the basis of their electron density in Fig. 3 and SI
Appendix, Fig. S5 to demonstrate the very similar protein configuration. This comparison also highlights the different relative
orientation of the chromophore with respect to the adjacent
secondary-structure elements, e.g., α4 and β5. This change in
absorption and conformation is not of generic nature as would
occur from unintended exposure of the crystal to light. Instead, it
is clearly limited to the location of the X-ray beam, as is apparent
by the absorbance of the crystal at the position of the X-ray beam
exposure recorded before and after the data collection conditions (SI Appendix, Fig. S7) that reveal an increase in absorbance
at the long-wavelength flank of the photoproduct spectrum. For
both recording conditions, the detection device is fully saturated,
and therefore generation of a difference spectrum and the determination of the absorption maximum are greatly impeded.
We identify the increase in absorbance in the range between
630 and 650 nm (shoulder in SI Appendix, Fig. S7) with the
dominant absorbance still documenting the photoproduct form
with λmax around 550 nm. With all precaution due to the experimental challenges, the maximum of the difference spectrum
is found around 640 nm.
Crystals of this hybrid form of Slr1393g3 diffracted to 2.1 Å
and contain one monomer per ASU. The entire sequence of
Slr1393g3 could be modeled into the electron density (residues
441 to 596) with three C-terminal residues of the expression tag
(Glu597, Leu598, Glu599; R values after refinement Rwork
17.0% and Rfree 22.2%, respectively; SI Appendix, Table S1). The
protein fold of this hybrid form is nearly identical to the Pg state
(rmsd 0.45 Å over 157 Cα atoms). The PCB chromophore is
further shifted into the protein cleft and positioned closer to
helix α4 compared to the Pr state, but shows a somewhat smaller
lateral rotation. The electron density around the chromophore
clearly identifies the PCB conformation as 15–16 Z (Z,Z,Z,s,s,a
configuration, Fig. 3B).
Despite the different C15–C16 isomeric state, there are only
few changes in the hydrogen bonding pattern between the PCB
chromophore and the Slr1393g3-Ph protein compared to the Pg
state (SI Appendix, Table S2 and Fig. S4). Trp496 remains oriented outward and in close proximity to Cys528 (more than 10 Å
apart from the D ring) being out of reach for any π-stacking. The
positionally conserved tryptophan in the ortholog protein
AnPixJg2 [Trp289, assigned as Trp90 by Narikawa et al. (19)]
had been suggested to move upon red-to-green conversion based
on molecular-dynamics simulations (24). These authors proposed a sideways movement of Trp289, causing an inflow of
water molecules into the binding pocket of the photoproduct

state as a potential explanation for the hypsochromic shift of the
absorption peak.
Also, the chromophore geometry in the Ph state shows barely
any changes in comparison to the Pg state despite the full isomerization of the C15–C16 double bond. The most noticeable modification in comparison to the Pg form is the change of the D ring
from an α-facial to a β-facial orientation. This is well reflected in the
dihedral angle of the single bond NC=14–15=16 = 142° (pdb labels:
NA=C4A-CHB=C1B) and visualized in Fig. 4. Besides that, the
twist of the A ring as well as the orientation of both propionates are
nearly coinciding with those in the Pg state. Therefore, this hybrid
form suits well to study the molecular mechanism that determines
the spectral tuning that cannot be deduced unambiguously from the
structures of the Pr and Pg forms. In the following, we apply
quantum-chemical calculations also for this structure along with the
parental state and the photoproduct.
Quantum-Chemical Calculations. The high-resolution structures of
both parental and photoproduct state for one and the same
protein encouraged us to investigate the spectral tuning mechanism of this protein using quantum-chemical calculations in a
separate publication (27). Here, we also address the hybrid (Ph)
structure by the ab initio quantum chemical method CC2 to
calculate the excitation energies and thereby to identify the parameters that cause the spectral shift due to its peculiar chromophore and protein conformation as outlined above.
Furthermore, the simulation allows us to determine the excitation energy of this hybrid state, which cannot be determined
from the crystal. The three structures Pr, Pg, and Ph were subjected to the same simulation protocol that comprised calculations of the vertical excitation energies for three sets of
geometries. The first set of geometries contained the chromophores extracted from the crystal structure and then fully relaxed
in vacuo (these models are called “vacuo”). The other two sets
were obtained from hybrid quantum-mechanics/molecularmechanics (QM/MM) calculations in which the chromophore
was optimized in the presence of a protein environment. These
models are denoted as “strained” and “protein.” Both of them
are based on the same chromophore geometry from the QM/
MM energy minimization, where the quantum chemically described chromophore was optimized while the protein was kept
at the crystallographic position (see Methods and SI Appendix for
full details). However, the protein models include the electrostatic effect of the environment, while in the strained models the
charges of the environment are set to zero. Hence, the systematic
comparison between the vacuo, strained, and protein models

allows to analyze the protein-induced effect on the excitation
energy (Fig. 5 and SI Appendix, Tables S3 and S4). In particular, it
allows us to decompose the effect in two contributions: the influence of the protein on the chromophore conformation and the
direct electrostatic effect on the excitation energy. While we have
addressed the latter for the Pr-to-Pg transition (27), the former
will give us further insight into the steric effect of the protein.
For Slr1393g3, the optimization of the vacuo models of the Pr
and Ph forms leads to two enantiomeric geometries as they are
mirror images of one another (SI Appendix, Figs. S9 and S10).
This difference stems from the opposed pretwist of all three
methine bridges in the crystal structures that serve as starting
points for the geometry optimization. In the Pr form the A and
the D rings are in the α-facial orientation, while in the hybrid
form both rings are in the β-facial orientation (SI Appendix, Figs.
S5 and S10). Hence, this leads to a negligible difference of
0.0013 eV (due to numerical accuracy) in the excitation energies
between the vacuo models of Pr and Ph forms. The absorption of
the Pg vacuo model shows a slight blue shift of 0.02 eV relative to
the other two forms, despite the isomerized 15–16 bond (SI Appendix, Tables S3 and S4). The larger difference of the Pg form
results from the steric interaction between the two methyl groups
at the C and D rings, which prevents a more planar geometry (SI
Appendix, Fig. S9C), in agreement with previous findings by
Rockwell et al. (28). Hence, we conclude that the spectral change
due to the double-bond isomerization is clearly below 0.1 eV.
The calculated excitation energies of the protein models are
systematically higher than the experimental absorption maxima
(Fig. 5 and SI Appendix, Table S3). For the Pr and Pg states, the
results deviate by +0.31 and +0.14 eV from the maxima, respectively. However, the computed Pr-to-Pg spectral shift is
0.23 eV, while the experimental value is 0.40 eV. Comparison
between the protein and strained models shows lower excitation
energies (0.13 and 0.12 eV for Pr and Pg, respectively). Therefore, the calculated spectral shift remains nearly unaltered with
0.24 eV. This indicates that the protein environment does not
have a direct electrostatic effect on the tuning of the photoproduct, and the spectral shift is mainly due to chromophore
distortions in the protein environment. This finding is supported
by the calculation of the excitation energy in the hybrid form.
The difference between the protein and the strained model of
the Ph form is 0.15 eV, similar to the other two forms.

The comparison of the strained to the vacuo models shows
that the excitation energies for the three vacuo geometries are
within 0.02 eV; however, there is a large variation of 0.24 eV for
the strained models. This spectral shift between the vacuo and
the strained model is increasing with the extent of the distortion
of the peripheral rings. For the Pr form, the smallest shift of
0.11 eV is associated with the A- and D-rings being 22° and 40°
out of the plane (SI Appendix, Table S5). The maximum shift due
to distortion from planarity is observed for the Pg form with
0.33 eV and corresponding A and D ring deviations of 63° and
61°. Interestingly, the Ph form lies in-between with 0.24 eV shift
and out-of-plane distortions of 62° and 32°. A superposition of
the chromophores from the Ph and Pg forms (Fig. 4) shows
that the A-ring and the propionates are nearly superimposable
and the difference originates mainly from the D-ring distortion
from the B–C plane, i.e., this shift of 0.11 eV between the Ph and
Pg form is mainly due to the D-ring rotation. In contrast, distortions of both peripheral rings from planarity are smaller in the Pr
form, indicating that it is not possible to separate the effect of the
A and D ring on the spectral tuning. However, the calculations
confirm the distortion imposed by the protein environment on the
chromophore as the mechanism of spectral tuning, supporting
previous studies by Lagarias and coworkers (18, 20, 28–30). It is
also in line with a correlation between the extent of coplanarity of
the pyrrole rings and the absorption maxima in the PCB chromophores of phycobilisomes presented by Zhao and coworkers
(31). This points to a more general mechanism of color regulation;
when following their approach for Slr1393g3 (Fig. 6), our findings
concur nicely with the proposal from Zhao and coworkers.
Discussion
The crystallization of cyanobacterial bilin-binding GAF3 domain
from Slr1393 in both parental and photoproduct states with high
resolution allows a direct comparison of conformational changes
induced by light in one and the same protein. On the basis of
these structural data, we could study the origin of the red/green
shift in Slr1393g3, which is in contrast to the red/far-red shift of
canonical phytochromes. Hence, the understanding of the factors leading to the change of the absorption could pave the way
for rational design of bilin-binding photoreceptors.
Despite the overall well-preserved tertiary structure of both
Slr1393g3 states, significant conformational changes are precisely
identified: Whereas the parental state shows a long unstructured
loop extending over the chromophore, part of this loop is formed
into a small α-helix in the photoproduct, thus adding structural stabilization to the chromophore conformation. Importantly, a tryptophan residue (Trp496), part of this loop and in π-stacking arrangement
with ring D in the parental state, is moved away from the isomerized
chromophore by ∼14 Å, opening the binding pocket to the external medium (Fig. 2). The chromophore isomerization causes also a rotation of the PCB molecule around its central
orthogonal axis such that Arg508 (interacting amino acid to the
propionate group of ring C in the parental state) now interacts
with the propionate group of ring B, concomitant with a reduction of the distance between chromophore and helix α4.
In addition to the direct comparison of two states of Slr1393g3,
important information was provided by the structural determination
of a hybrid form with the protein in the photoproduct conformation and the chromophore in the parental-state–like 15-Z conformation. This structure unveils key factors affecting the
absorption and challenges previously proposed mechanisms that
regulate the absorbance of the various states. In the X-ray beamexposed parts of the crystal, the chromophore conformation is
clearly assigned as 15-Z configuration (Fig. 3B), irrespective of
the presence (parental state) or absence (photoproduct) of the
π-stacking Trp496, and unaffected by an altered protein surrounding, including interactions with amino acids and the water
molecules. It demonstrates that a change in absorption does not

originate from the rearrangement of the binding pocket as proposed
earlier on the basis of classical molecular-dynamics simulations (24),
but the absorption properties are intrinsic to the distortion of the
chromophore itself. Both 15-Z and 15-E isomers of Slr1393g3 show
high out-of-plane distortions of A- and D-rings, although the angles
are different for each state (Fig. 4). Strong distortions in the A- and
D-ring dihedral angles are also found in various phytochrome
structures (SI Appendix, Table S6); however, so far, no attention has
been given to the relation of distortional angles and absorption.
This additional information along with our quantum-chemical calculations strongly support the proposed mechanism of spectral
tuning where the chromophore conformation is mainly responsible
for the absorption in agreement with recent calculations (27).
Although being instrumental for the identification of factors
regulating the absorption maxima, the mechanisms for formation of
the hybrid form remain unsolved. As commented above, we can
exclude radiation damage as a potential effect and also unintended
background illumination, as the “color change” is clearly focused on
the X-ray beam exposed position. One might speculate that the Xray exposure generates a global increase of protein dynamics, potentially sufficient for the chromophore to overcome a very shallow
barrier and to commence isomerization. It is tempting to assign this
hybrid structure to an early intermediate of the Pg-to-Pr conversion,
as it proceeds into the “correct” direction (15-E to 15-Z). However,
experiments by time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy documenting
a concomitant change of the protein conformation would be essential to propose an involvement of this hybrid form in the Pg-toPr conversion, and thus, a speculation of its biological role appears
to be reaching out much too far.
Methods
Protein Preparation. GAF3 domain of Slr1393 from the cyanobacterium
Synechocystis PCC6803 was prepared and purified as recently described,
following two protocols for chromophore assembly: 1) a two-plasmid expression protocol yields protein and chromophore during expression (in
vivo) and allows formation of the holoprotein during biosynthesis (9, 17),
and 2) an in vitro assembly by expressing the apoprotein and adding the PCB
chromophore after the IMAC purification (details in SI Appendix).

the webservice “PDBsum Generate” (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/
databases/pdbsum/Generate.html).
Absorption Spectra of Slr1393g3 Crystals. For recording the absorption spectra, two crystals of Slr1393g3 in photoproduct state were used (mounted in
loops): one remained unexposed to X-rays (pink crystal), and the other one
was measured after collection of a complete dataset (areas exposed to the Xray beam turned to dark blue, whereas the unexposed parts of the crystal
remained pink). Absorption was measured at 100 K at ID29S-Cryobench (ESRF,
Grenoble, France) (40).
QM/MM Calculations. The crystal structures of Slr1393g3 [PDB ID codes 5DFX
(Pr), 5M82 (Pg), and 5M85 (hybrid form)] that are reported in this study were
used as a starting point for hybrid QM/MM calculations. The full details of the
computational setup of the protein and the subsequent QM/MM calculations
are given in SI Appendix. The models obtained at the RI-CC2/cc-pVDZ/Amber
level of theory of the chromophore inside the frozen protein are denoted
“protein.” In these models, all atoms of the environment within a distance
of 12 Å to any of the QM atoms were taken into account via point charges in
the excited state calculations. In the strained models, the environment
represented by point charges was discarded, but the QM region is kept in
the protein-induced geometry. A full relaxation of the strained models in
the gas phase resulted in the vacuo models.
We have used the ab initio RI-CC2 method to go beyond the semiempirical
DFTB2+D-based optimizations in our previous study. The excited-state calculations were realized consistently to the ground state description by using
the same method. The RI-CC2 calculations were done in Turbomole (10),
which is interfaced with ChemShell (11) for QM/MM calculations. Details of
the optimizations and excited-state calculations are given in SI Appendix.

Data Collection.
Slr1393g3-Pr state (in vivo). Data were collected at 100 K from a single crystal at
ID29, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) (Grenoble, France). Data
were processed by XDS and XSCALE (32, 33). The structure was solved by
molecular replacement (MR) using the autorickshaw pipeline (34) providing
the protein sequence and processed data as input files. The structural models
of this protein, its in vitro-assembled counterpart, the photoproduct, and the
hybrid form were further built and refined using iterative cycles of manual
building in coot (35) and refinement cycles using REFMAC5 (36) from the
ccp4 suite (37). The structure was deposited in the PDB under ID code 5DFX.
Slr1393g3-Pr state (in vitro). Data were collected at 100 K from a single crystal at
ID23-1, ESRF (Grenoble, France). Data were processed by XDS (32, 33). The
structure was solved by MR using 5DFX as search model. For structural model
building and refinement, see above (Pr form).
Slr1393g3-hybrid state. Data were collected at 100 K from a single crystal at P13,
DESY, EMBL, Hamburg, Germany (38). During data collection the crystal area
exposed to X-rays immediately turned from pink to dark blue indicating a
conformational change in the chromophore arrangement. Data were processed by XDS (32). The structure was solved by MR using 5DFX as search
model. Structural model building and refinement see above.
Slr1393g3-Pg state. Data were collected at 100 K from a single crystal at P13,
German Synchrotron Radiation Facility (DESY), European Molecular Biology
Laboratory (EMBL) (Hamburg, Germany) (38). Experienced from using the
pink (photoproduct) crystals for determination of the hybrid state, we knew
the crystal area exposed to X-rays was highly susceptible to turn from pink to
blue; we here used a helical data collection strategy with minimum exposure
time and minimum total oscillation to reduce the effect of the X-rays to the
chromophore arrangement (39). Data were processed by XDS (32, 33). The
structure was solved by MR using 5DFX as search model. For structural model
building and refinement, see above.
Detailed information about all data collection and refinement statistics are
given in SI Appendix, Fig. S1.
Images of the models were prepared using PyMOL (the PyMOL Molecular
Graphics System). The 2D ligand plots of interactions were generated using

BIOCHEMISTRY

Crystallization Conditions and Structure Determination.
Slr1393g3-Pr state, in vivo. Initial crystals were optimized using sitting-drop
vapor diffusion method with drops containing of 1 μL of protein solution
(10 mg/mL in 50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl) mixed with 1 μL of
reservoir solution (0.02 M Tris·HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 M sodium chloride, 7.7%
[wt/vol] PEG 4000), equilibrated over 300-μL reservoir at 12 °C. Crystallization
experiments were set up under dim green light, and crystallization plates
were covered with aluminum foil. Blue rhomboid-shaped crystals grew to a
final size of 100 × 100 × 70 μm3 within 8 wk. All crystal-containing drops (see
also following) were overlaid with mineral oil for cryoprotection before
harvesting the crystals, and crystals were shock-frozen with liquid nitrogen.
Slr1393g3-Pr state, in vitro. Crystallization trials and crystal harvesting were
performed as described above but under different crystallization conditions and
in hanging drops. The optimized precipitant contained 0.02 M sodium citrate,
pH 5.6, 0.1 M sodium chloride, and 11% (wt/vol) PEG 3350. Blue rhomboidshaped crystals grew to a final size of 120 × 120 × 100 μm3 within 8 wk.
Slr1393g3-Pg state and -hybrid state. Prior to crystallization experiments, the
protein solution was irradiated with red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to
generate the photoproduct state. All crystallization experiments were set up
under dim red light. Initial crystals were optimized using sitting-drop vapor
diffusion method with drops containing 1 μL of protein solution (8–10
mg/mL in 50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl) mixed with 1-μL reservoir solution (0.1 M CAPSO, pH 9.5, 0.1 M sodium chloride, 100 to 175 mM lithium
sulfate, 12 to 14% [wt/vol] PEG 4000), equilibrated over 300-μL reservoir at
4 °C. The crystallization plates were kept under red light. Pink rhomboidshaped crystals grew to a final size of 90 × 90 × 60 μm3 within 2 wk.
