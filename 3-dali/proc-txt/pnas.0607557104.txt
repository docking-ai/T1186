Combating bacterial resistance to ␤-lactams, the most widely used
antibiotics, is an emergent and clinically important challenge.
OXA-24 is a class D ␤-lactamase isolated from a multiresistant
epidemic clinical strain of Acinetobacter baumannii. We have
investigated how OXA-24 specifically hydrolyzes the last resort
carbapenem antibiotic, and we have determined the crystal structure of OXA-24 at a resolution of 2.5 Å. The structure shows that
the carbapenem’s substrate specificity is determined by a hydrophobic barrier that is established through the specific arrangement
of the Tyr-112 and Met-223 side chains, which define a tunnel-like
entrance to the active site. The importance of these residues was
further confirmed by mutagenesis studies. Biochemical and microbiological analyses of specific point mutants selected on the basis
of structural criteria significantly reduced the catalytic efficiency
(kcat/Km) against carbapenems, whereas the specificity for oxacillin
was noticeably increased. This is the previously unrecognized
crystal structure that has been obtained for a class D carbapenemase enzyme. Accordingly, this information may help to improve
the development of effective new drugs to combat ␤-lactam
resistance. More specifically, it may help to overcome carbapenem
resistance in A. baumannii, probably one of the most worrying
infectious threats in hospitals worldwide.

acteria hydrolyze ␤-lactam antibiotics primarily by using ␤-lactamases in an acylation–deacylation-based process. By inactivating peptidoglycan transpeptidases, members of the family of
penicillin-binding proteins, ␤-lactam antibiotics have been successfully used for many years to inhibit the peptidoglycan synthesis
responsible for the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall (1, 2).
␤-lactamases can be divided into four classes (A, B, C, and D)
according to their sequence similarities (3). On the basis of their
different catalytic mechanisms, two groups have been established
whereby class B enzymes are metalloproteins that require zinc for
their activity, and class A, C, and D ␤-lactamases contain serine
groups in their active site (4). Oxacillinases are Ambler class D
␤-lactamases with hydrolytic activity against penicillins, extendedspectrum cephalosporins, methicillin, and aztreonam (5).
Recently, a new type of oxacillinases with carbapenemase activity
has been identified in different parts of the world (6–11). In contrast
to the other oxacillinases, most of these new OXA-type carbapenemases lack hydrolytic activity against oxacillin, cloxacillin, and
methicillin, and they display resistance to carbapenems (9, 12).
Based on their amino acid sequence, these OXA-type carbapenemases can be grouped into eight different clusters (13). Moreover,
these enzymes have been seen to be widely dispersed in some
clinically relevant species, such as Acinetobacter baumannii (where
four groups have been identified: OXA-23, OXA-24, OXA-51,
OXA-58, and their variants) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
(OXA-50 family; ref. 13). Carbapenems are the remaining drug of
choice to treat these multiresistant pathogens, which may be

responsible for severe nosocomial infections. Hence, the emergence
of OXA-type carbapenemases raises a particularly disturbing problem (12, 14).
The structures of class A and C ␤-lactamases, as well as that of
the prototypic class D oxacillinases (OXA-1, OXA-2, OXA-10, and
OXA-13), have been determined (15–19). Comparison of these
active-serine enzymes has identified similarities in their overall
folding involving one helical and one mixed ␣ /␤ domain and three
highly conserved active site elements in a cleft located between the
two domains that are involved in hydrolysis. Despite these similarities, important differences both adjacent to the active site and in
the omega loop region may establish their specific hydrolytic
profiles (17, 18). However, no structures of a class D carbapenemase are currently available.
Here, we present a previously unrecognized three-dimensional
structure describing a class D carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinase,
OXA-24, extracted from a clinically epidemic multidrug-resistant
A. baumannii strain (9). In combination with mutagenesis, biochemical experiments, and modeling, these data suggest a plausible
mechanism that may be associated with carbapenem hydrolysis of
a class D carbapenemase enzyme. Moreover, our structural and
biochemical studies provide the molecular basis to explain the
acquisition of carbapenem specificity. Together this information
could serve as a starting point for the development of new antimicrobial agents given that there is clearly a specific need for a potent
class D ␤-lactamase inhibitor to bridge the existing therapeutic void.
Results
Overall Folding. The approximate dimensions of OXA-24 are 58 ⫻

46 ⫻ 38 Å, and structurally it involves an ␣/␤ fold where the helices
are exposed to the solvent surrounding the core of the central
␤-sheet (Fig. 1a). The molecule can be separated into two domains,
one helical and one of a mixed ␣/␤ structure containing a central
six-stranded antiparallel ␤-sheet. The N- and C-terminal helices (␣1
and ␣9) can be found on one side of this ␤-sheet, and there is a
single 310 helix (␣3) on the other. The active site has an overall
positive charge, and it lies between the interface of the ␤-sheet and
the helical subdomain, adopting the appearance of an extended
cleft (Fig. 1b). The catalytic-binding pocket is formed by the ␤4
strand together with the N-terminal end of the 310 ␣3 helix and the

loop between the ␣4 and ␣5 helices. In the absence of substrate, the
cavity is filled by a sulfate ion and a network of water molecules,
thereby providing a set of contact points that can be encountered
upon antibiotic accommodation.
The structure displays an overall organization very similar to that
found in other class A, C, and D ␤-lactamases (15–19), as well as
in other DD-transpeptidases (20, 21). For example, the rms difference in the atomic positions for the common C␣ residues of
OXA-24 is 1.3 Å (225 C␣ atoms) when compared with that of the
oxacillinase class D ␤-lactamase OXA-10 (17, 19) and 2.4 Å (169 C␣
atoms) when compared with a typical class A enzyme (Escherichia
coli TEM-1; ref. 22). The nucleus of the ␤-sheet and almost all of
the adjacent ␣-helices (␣1, ␣3, and ␣5 to ␣9) can be readily
superimposed when considering this group of active-serine enzymes [supporting information (SI) Fig. 6 a and b] (23). However,
despite the high degree of similarity mentioned above, a number of
differences with respect to the overall folding may contribute to the
particular specificity for ␤-lactam as well as variations in regions
adjacent to the active site (24).
Structural Homology to the Class D Oxacillinase Family. Protein

folding is thought to be well conserved between OXA-24 and the
oxacillinase members of class D ␤-lactamases with defined structures, namely the following: OXA-1 from E. coli (15), OXA-2 from
Salmonella typhimurium (PDB ID code IK38), and both OXA-10
and OXA-13 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17–19). Although the
sequence identity with other members of the oxacillinase family
only ranges from 23% with OXA-1 to 39% with OXA-10, the
position of the secondary structural elements in the helical and the
mixed ␣/␤ domains are highly conserved in OXA-24. However,
significant differences were observed in several regions of OXA-24
when compared with other OXA structures. For example, the
biggest difference was observed at the N terminus (Fig. 2a), which
exhibits an elongated ␣-helix (␣1) in OXA-24 instead of the
common ␤1/␣1 motif present in the oxacillinase family. In this
respect, OXA-24 closely resembles the N terminus of the TEM-type
class A ␤-lactamases (Fig. 6b; ref. 22).
The relative orientation of the short ␤3 strand at the top of the
binding site, directly implicated in dimerization, is different from
the topologically equivalent strand of the three dimeric oxacillinases [OXA-2 (PDB ID code IK38), -10, and -13; refs. 17–19].

superposition of OXA-24 (cyan) and the oxacillinase members of class D ␤-lactamases of known structure, OXA-1 (yellow), OXA-2 (navy blue), OXA-10 (red), and
OXA-13 (green), highlighting the major structural differences. OXA-24 displays
an elongated ␣-helix (␣1) at the N terminus and the ␤3 strand implicated in
dimerization in other oxacillinases is directed toward the C-terminal helix (␣9).
Important differences can also be observed in the ⍀-loop. (c) Detail of the
nonpolar region at the lower border of the active binding cleft. The hydrophobic
core formed by several nonpolar residues (Val-78, Val-225, Val-229, and Trp-231)
contributes to the stability of the solvent-exposed ␤4-␤5 loop and partially blocks
the access to the bottom part of the cleft.

However, it is similar to that observed in the monomeric OXA-1
structure (15). Hence, the ␤3 strand is bent ⬇30° inward when
compared with its position at the equivalent dimerization interface in the oxacillinase family. Thus, it is directed toward the
C-terminal helix (␣9), disrupting a set of potentially favorable
interactions and thereby interfering with dimer formation. Size
exclusion chromatography and analytical centrifugation showed
that OXA-24 exists exclusively as a monomer at concentrations
between 0.1 and 100 ␮M.
A further interesting difference that was observed at the lower
border of the active binding cleft involves the loop connecting the
␤4 and ␤5 strands (Fig. 2b). Maximum displacement was observed
at residue Gly-224, which in comparison with the corresponding
loop from the OXA structures is shifted toward the center of the
binding groove in the direction of the ⍀-loop (4.6 Å in OXA-1 and
6.8 Å in OXA-10; refs. 15, 17, and 19). Moreover, the movement of
the ␤4-␤5 loop in OXA-24 partially blocks the bottom part of the
groove in the cleft. Because of the lateral chains of several nonpolar
residues (Val-78, Val-225, Val-229, and Trp-231), this movement
probably creates a hydrophobic core, thereby contributing to the
stability of the solvent-exposed loop (Fig. 2c). This dynamic behavior nourished the assumption that the movements of these loops
may determine the specificity of distinct OXA variants for diverse
␤-lactams (23).
The ␤-Lactam Active Site. The OXA-24 ␤-lactam active site is readily
discernible at the junction of the two domains (Fig. 1a). In
agreement with previous studies (17–21), it comprises residues from
the ␤4 strand together with those coming from the N-terminal end
of the 310-helix ␣3 and a number of residues from the loop between
helices ␣4 and ␣5 (Fig. 3a). This region includes three common

Fig. 3. Close-up view of the ␤-lactam active site in OXA-24. (a) Representation of the active site elements (17). The first element (gray) is located at the
N-terminal end of the 310-helix ␣3, and it is formed by residues Ser-81-Thr-82Phe-83-Lys-84. The second motif (green), Ser-128-Ala-129-Val-130, lies in the
loop connecting helices ␣4 and ␣5. The third active site element (cyan) is
formed by the residues Lys-218-Ser-219-Gly-220 from the ␤4 strand. (b) Detailed interactions showing the contact network at the active site (shown as

motifs that converge to form the active site, and these are referred
to as the active site elements (17).
The first of these elements lies at the N-terminal end of the
310-helix ␣3, and it is formed by residues Ser-81-Thr-82-Phe-83Lys-84. This element contains the catalytic serine residue Ser-81,
which acts as the nucleophile in the acylation step of the reaction
(17). Indeed, together with Lys-84 this residue is included in the first
of the three signature sequences conserved within penicillinbinding proteins/␤-lactamases, the Ser-X-X-Lys motif (25). As well
as establishing contacts with water molecules in the cleft, the
hydroxyl group of Ser-81 establishes a weaker hydrogen bond with
the N␨ of Lys-84 (3.35 Å) than that observed in other oxacillinases
(2.9 Å in OXA-10; ref. 17). The relative weakness of this interaction
is compensated by a slight movement of Lys-84 within the crevice,
pointing to the ⍀-loop, which forms a hydrogen bond with the side
chain nitrogen of the conserved Trp-167 (3.55 Å, Fig. 3b).
The second active site element in class D ␤-lactamases lies in the
loop connecting ␣4 and ␣5 helices, and it is represented by the
conserved motif Ser-128/X/Val-Ile (Fig. 3a). The lateral hydroxyl
chain of Ser-128 is accommodated in the direction of the activeserine Ser-81, forming hydrogen bonds with the neighboring residues: O␥ Ser-128—O␥ Ser-81 (2.92 Å), O␥ Ser-128—N␨ Lys-84
(3.17 Å), and O␥ Ser-128—O SO4 (2.86 Å, Fig. 3b). Accordingly,

the hydrogen bond network associated with Ser-128 presents subtle
differences with that of the rest of the oxacillinase family. A further
characteristic feature within this second element is the presence of
a nonpolar residue (Val-130), which is unique to class D enzymes
(5). The nonpolar side chain of Val-130 may contribute to the broad
substrate specificity of the class D enzymes. Indeed, not only is this
side chain a major determinant for cleaving substrates with bulkier
side groups (i.e., the isoxazolyl moiety of oxacillins), but it also
participates in hydrophobic rather than hydrogen bonding interactions (17, 19, 26). Moreover, recent studies on clinical isolates of
carbapenem multiresistant A. baumannii reveal a new subgroup in
the OXA carbapenemase family (27). As observed in OXA-51 (10),
all enzymes of the novel subgroup 3 carbapenem-resistant A.
baumannii had a conserved valine to isoleucine substitution in the
second element of the active site S-X-V.
Several residues from the ␤4 strand form the upper part of the
cleft, which runs horizontally from left to right and includes the
conserved Lys-218-Ser-219-Gly-220 sequence of the third active site
element (Lys/X/Gly consensus sequence, Fig. 3a; ref. 25). The
conformation of this segment is virtually identical to the Lys-205Thr-206-Gly-207 component of the oxacillinase class D ␤-lactamases. Notably, this region has also been shown to be essential for the
binding of the carboxylate group of ␤-lactam antibiotics in penicillin-binding proteins and in class A and D ␤-lactamases (28, 29).
Moreover, the guanidinium group of Arg-261 protruding from the
␣9 helix is located in an area similar to Arg-250 in OXA-10 (17). In
OXA-10, this group interacts with a sulfate ion in the active site,
resembling the carboxylate group of the substrate in the x-ray
structures of acyl-enzyme complexes (28, 29). Thus, the fact that
there is close structural similarity between the ␤-lactam active site
of OXA-24 and the oxacillinases strongly suggests that the hydrolytic mechanism used by OXA-24 is similar to that of other class D
␤-lactamases (25).
The differences at the ␤-lactam active site in OXA-24 are subtle.
Nevertheless, despite the overall similarity in folding, significant
differences must arise between OXA-24, a class D oxacillinase with
carbapenemase activity, and structurally related oxacillinases to
account for the functional differences (i.e., its hydrolytic activity
toward carbapenems as well as its apparent lack of activity against
oxacillin).
Molecular Basis for Carbapenem Specificity. The three common

motifs around the active site that are important for enzyme activity
were identified in structural studies on both native oxacillinases
(15–17, 19) and when it exists in a complex with meropenem and
imipenem (18). Moreover, the mechanism by which class D ␤-lactamases hydrolyze ␤-lactam antibiotics is thought to be slightly
different from that observed in class A and C enzymes (17).
However, as recently pointed out (13), the structural information
currently available does not enable us to define structure/function
relationships that might help us to understand the mechanisms
associated with carbapenem hydrolysis in the OXA-type carbapenemases. Likewise, we are unable to identify the key residues that
modulate this specificity.
Nevertheless, by more closely examining the molecular surface of
the active site, the entrance to the cleft of OXA-24 differs significantly from that of OXA-10, a representative member of the
oxacillinase family (Fig. 4 a and b). Indeed, direct hydrophobic
interactions orchestrate a specific arrangement of the Tyr-112 and
Met-223 side chains to create a hydrophobic barrier. To some extent
this barrier restricts access to the cleft, defining a tunnel-like
entrance to the active site. This hydrophobic environment over the
active site is stabilized by other hydrophobic contacts, for example,
those of Thr-111, Trp-115, and Trp-221, thereby contributing to the
stability of the nonpolar interface.
The tunnel has a diameter of ⬇6.3 Å, which permits it to directly
regulate the shape and chemical nature of the antibiotics that can
access the active site before catalysis and those that may reach the

of the hydroxyethyl moieties of imipenem and meropenem and the
hydrophobic character of the tunnel-like channel are suitable to
accommodate carbapenems, in accordance with the substrate affinity of OXA-24. Accordingly, we investigated the effect that point

baumannii.

catalytic Ser-81 residue. A comparison of the chemical structures of
oxacillin and the carbapenems, imipenem, and meropenem (Fig.
4c) should further elucidate how the selective hydrolytic behavior
of OXA-24 arises. The bulky methylphenylisoxazolyl moiety of the
oxacillin molecule is located at the left position of the ␤-lactam ring.
Therefore, access of this substrate to the active site in the wild-type
(WT) OXA-24 enzyme may be difficult, because of both steric
restrictions and the architecture of the catalytic binding site. Interestingly, this feature may account for the relatively lower activity of
OXA-24 toward this antibiotic when compared with other oxacillinases (kcat/Km ⬇ 200 mM⫺1 s⫺1). On the other hand, the small size

hibitory concentration (MIC) values of A. baumannii JC7/04 expressing either WT OXA-24 or its single or double mutants are
shown in Table 1. Because the A. baumannii host is intrinsically
resistant to most ␤-lactam antibiotics (with the exception of carbapenems), the susceptibility to ampicillin and oxacillin can be
measured only by kinetic experiments with purified OXA-enzymes.
With carbapenems, clear imipenem and meropenem resistance was
observed (following NCCLS breakpoints) when the WT OXA-24
was expressed in A. baumannii (Table 1), yielding MIC values of 32
and 64 ␮g/ml, respectively. In contrast to the M223A substitution
that slightly decreased the carbapenem MIC values (Table 1), the
Y112A mutation diminished both the imipenem and meropenem
MIC values to 4 and 1, respectively (NCCLS susceptibility breakpoints were established as ⱕ4 ␮g/ml). When both amino acid
changes were introduced into WT OXA-24 together to produce the
OXA-24 double mutant (DM), the MIC for imipenem decreased
to 4 ␮g/ml, whereas meropenem practically reached the basal levels
found in A. baumannii with the pAT-RA plasmid (negative
control).
To further clarify the role of the Tyr-112 and Met-223 residues
in the carbapenemase activity of OXA-24, biochemical experiments
were carried out using purified WT OXA-24, OXA-24-Y112A
(because this substitution seemed more important than M223A),
and the OXA-24 DM (the overall kinetic results from these
experiments are shown in Table 2). With regard to ampicillin, the
kcat/Km ratio was three to six times lower in both OXA-24 mutants
than in WT OXA-24. Indeed, although kcat was similar in each of
the three proteins, the Km was clearly higher for the mutated
enzymes. Thus, the reduced catalytic efficiency against ampicillin in

the mutated proteins was due to a reduced affinity rather than to
changes in the turnover rate (kcat).
With respect to oxacillin, the activity of OXA-24 toward this
antibiotic (kcat/Km ⬇ 200) was very low when compared with other
oxacillinases. However, the Y112A and M223A substitutions induced significant higher increase in activity of ⬎3-fold. In contrast,
both imipenem and meropenem were readily degraded by WT
OXA-24 with high catalytic efficiency (Table 2). The mutated
OXA-24-Y112A and OXA-24–DM displayed weaker catalytic
efficiency against carbapenems, although this effect was more
drastic with meropenem (the meropenem kcat/Km ratios were 456
and 155 times lower in the OXA-24 DM and OXA-24 Y112A,
respectively). Interestingly, the Km for imipenem and meropenem
was much higher in both OXA-24-Y112A and OXA-24-DM,
whereas the kcat remained almost identical in both the WT OXA-24
and the mutant enzymes. Although Met-223 is close to the KSG
domain, the Tyr-112 and Met-223 residues lie outside of the active
center, and they are not directly involved in ␤-lactam catalysis.
Thus, the biochemical data are consistent with the structural data
in that they suggest that the Tyr-112-Met-223 ‘‘hydrophobic barrier’’ is the main factor that dictates the biochemical properties of
the OXA-24 enzyme. Indeed, no real change in the active center of
the OXA-24 enzyme can be responsible for the changes in the
kinetic parameters toward carbapenems because the kcat values of
the mutant OXA-24 enzymes with respect to meropenem were
almost identical to that of the WT. However, there was a clear
reduction in the kcat/Km ratio with both Y112A and DM, suggesting
that in the absence of this tunnel-like entrance, carbapenems are
not correctly orientated and therefore cannot gain access to the
active center.
Discussion
OXA-24 is a carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D ␤-lactamase isolated
from a multiresistant clinical isolate of A. baumannii, which is
naturally highly resistant to carbapenem antibiotics (9). There is a
worldwide increase in the resistance of bacterial pathogens to
carbapenem antibiotics associated with the production of OXAtype ␤-lactamases (9, 12, 30). Hence, these enzymes become
interesting candidates for structural studies to determine the molecular mechanism of carbapenem resistance at the atomic level.
From the crystal structure of OXA-24, a plausible model for its
carbapenem binding specificity has been generated. In this model,
a pair of amino acid residues (Tyr-112 and Met-223) emerges that
are directly related to this resistance and that confers unique
structural features to a carbapenemase enzyme. The relative orientation of both key residues delimits the access to the catalytic
binding-site, underlining the importance of the appropriate positioning of the antibiotic for optimal recognition (20). Furthermore,
a change in the conformation of the ␤4-␤5 loop toward the lower
boundary of the cleft of the active site partially blocks the bottom
part of the channel, acting like a flip lid, and this generates a
hydrophobic core using the lateral chains of several nonpolar
residues (Fig. 2c).
The docking of imipenem and meropenem within the binding site
fully supports the proposed role of Tyr-112 and Met-223 in establishing specificity and yields further insight into how the ␤-lactam
antibiotic complex is formed (Fig. 5 a and b). Notably, the substrate
is visibly anchored into the tunnel-like cavity of the active site with
no significant displacement of the protein side-chains. Carbapenem
molecules bind through the carboxylate and the 6␣-hydroxyethyl
groups at the left position of the ␤-lactam ring (Fig. 4c) through two
types of interactions: a strong salt-bridge contact between the
carboxylate group of the antibiotic and the guanidinium moiety of
Arg-261; and a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of the
drug and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen atom of Trp-221, as well
as a favorable van der Waals interaction between the aliphatic
methyl group and the nonpolar Val-130 residue. Moreover, the
sulfur-containing side-chain at position 3 of the carbapenem ring

Models of OXA-24 with carbapenems, based on the published structures (18),
were manually fitted onto the active site and then subjected to energy
minimization by using the CNS program (16). (c) Schematic representation of
the active site of OXA-24 with a hypothetical oxacillin molecule. The bulk
side-chain of this ␤-lactam antibiotic, at position 6 of the ␤-lactam ring,
collides with the hydrophobic barrier at the tunnel-like entrance. (d) Important catalytic residues in the active site. The Tyr-112 residue seems to be
essential for catalytic efficiency against carbapenems because it hooks the
6-␣-hydroxyethyl group of these ␤-lactam antibiotics before catalysis. (e) The
hypothetical active site cavity of the OXA-24 double mutant. The binding
modus of oxacillin in the double mutant mimics the specific binding of
isoxazolyl penicillin derivatives to the open cleft of oxacillinases (17, 19).

(aminomethylideneamino-ethyl sulfanyl of imipenem and
5-dimethylcarbamoyl pyrrolidin-2yl sulfanyl of meropenem) runs
almost parallel to the active site by stacking with various residues on
the hydrophobic surface of the cleft (i.e., Tyr-112, Met-114, Trp115, and Leu-127). The derived molecular modeling interactions
are consistent with some of the key features of the ligand binding
properties inferred from the OXA-13-meropenem complex (18). In
turn, this explains why carbapenems but not isoxazolyl penicillins
such as oxacillin, with bulkier substituents at position 6 of the
␤-lactam ring, are specifically degraded by OXA-24 (Fig. 5c).
Finally, to validate the structural model and to clarify how the
Tyr-112 and Met-223 residues participate in carbapenem specificity,
structural mutants were constructed. Our structural and mutagenesis studies demonstrate that Tyr-112 and Met-223 are important
for the carbapenemase activity of OXA-24. With carbapenems,
clear imipenem and meropenem resistance was observed when WT
OXA-24 was expressed in A. baumannii. Although substitution of
Met-223 by alanine (M223A) slightly diminishes the carbapenem
MIC values, the mutant Y112A significantly decreased imipenem
and meropenem MIC values. When both amino acid changes were
introduced in WT OXA-24 together, the imipenem MIC decreased
to 4 ␮g/ml, whereas meropenem practically reached basal levels.
Biochemical experiments also confirm the lower catalytic efficiency
of the selected mutants against carbapenems. With either Y112A or
the double mutant there was a clear reduction in the kcat/Km ratio,
which suggests that in the absence of the characteristic tunnel-like
entrance carbapenems are not correctly orientated and therefore,
they cannot properly reach the active center. The role of Tyr-112
seems to be essential for catalytic efficiency against carbapenems as
it hooks the 6-␣-hydroxyethyl side chain of these ␤-lactam antibiotics (31) before catalysis (Fig. 5d). Interestingly, the substitution of
these residues in OXA-24 confers almost a 4-fold increase in the
hydrolytic activity for oxacillin, even though the activity of the WT
enzyme against this ␤-lactam antibiotic is very low. This may be
related to the abrogation of the tunnel-like entrance to the active
site in the WT OXA-24, a phenomenon that is avoided when this
channel is eliminated in the double mutant (Fig. 5e). In this respect,
the binding modus of oxacillin in the double mutant mimics the way

Antimicrobial Agents and Determination of MICs. Antibiotic suscep-

tibility profiles were determined by microdilution following National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards criteria (32).
In addition, the MICs for the following antibiotics were confirmed
by the E test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden): ampicillin (AM),
imipenem (IP), and meropenem (MP).
Site-Directed Mutagenesis and Cloning Procedures. PCR was used to
amplify the gene coding for WT and mutated oxa-24 genes (oxa24–Y112A, oxa-24–M223A, and oxa-24 DM). These WT OXA-24
and mutated genes were then cloned into the pAT-RA plasmid, a
previously described E. coli–A. baumannii shuttle plasmid (at the
SmaI and EcoRI restriction sites), under the control of the CTXM-14 ␤-lactamase gene promoter.
Purification and Kinetic Experiments. The WT OXA-24 and mutated
genes were subcloned into pGEX-6p-1 (BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites) to generate a fusion protein between GST and the
OXA-24 genes lacking the signal peptide. The ␤-lactamase was
then purified to homogeneity following the manufacturer’s instructions for the GST Gene Fusion System (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech, Europe GmbH, Barcelona, Spain). Kinetic experiments
were performed as described (33).
Crystallization, Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement. Crystals of recombinant OXA-24 were obtained in 2 M

(NH4)2SO4 buffered with 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5). Data
were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility
(Grenoble, France) beamline BM16 by using a single frozen crystal
(100 K) (see SI Table 3). Data were processed and refined as
described in SI Text.

that isoxazolyl penicillin derivatives specifically bind to the open
cleft of oxacillinases (17, 19).
Furthermore, the structure-based multiple sequence alignment
(see SI Fig. 7) provides additional information regarding the
differences in the catalytic properties of these two members of the
class D ␤-lactamases, oxacillinases, and carbapenemases. The determinants for substrate specificity of OXA-24 are shared by other
subgroups of carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D ␤-lactamases
(CHDLs), mainly found in A. baumannii, and represented by
OXA-23, OXA-51, and OXA-58, which can be either plasmid- or
chromosomally encoded (13). In fact, all CHDLs possess an aromatic residue (Tyr or Phe) at the position equivalent to Tyr-112 in
the OXA-24 sequence, whereas the second key residue at position
223, Met in OXA-24, may accommodate either methionine or
tryptophan. The amino acid similarities found in these two key
residues for carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzymes are extensive
enough to suggest that they are crucial for the architecture of the
tunnel-like active site that permits the specific accommodation of
the 6␣-1R-hydroxyethyl group of carbapenems but not for antibiotics with bulkier groups at position 6 of the ␤-lactam ring (i.e.,
oxacillin, cloxacillin, and methicillin).
To our knowledge this is a previously unrecognized description
of the structural and biochemical mechanisms associated with
carbapenem hydrolysis in a class D carbapenemase enzyme. The
findings of this study provide structural information that helps us to
understand the molecular basis underlying the acquisition of carbapenem specificity and could serve as a starting point for the
development of new antimicrobial agents.
