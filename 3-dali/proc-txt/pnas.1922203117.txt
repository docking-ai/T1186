Gram-negative bacteria expressing class A β-lactamases pose a serious health threat due to their ability to inactivate all β-lactam antibiotics. The acyl–enzyme intermediate is a central milestone in the
hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by these enzymes. However, the protonation states of the catalytic residues in this complex have never
been fully analyzed experimentally due to inherent difficulties. To
help unravel the ambiguity surrounding class A β-lactamase catalysis, we have used ultrahigh-resolution X-ray crystallography and the
recently approved β-lactamase inhibitor avibactam to trap the acyl–
enzyme complex of class A β-lactamase CTX-M-14 at varying pHs. A
0.83-Å-resolution CTX-M-14 complex structure at pH 7.9 revealed a
neutral state for both Lys73 and Glu166. Furthermore, the avibactam hydroxylamine-O-sulfonate group conformation varied according to pH, and this conformational switch appeared to correspond
to a change in the Lys73 protonation state at low pH. In conjunction
with computational analyses, our structures suggest that Lys73 has
a perturbed acid dissociation constant (pKa) compared with acyl–
enzyme complexes with β-lactams, hindering its function to deprotonate Glu166 and the initiation of the deacylation reaction. Further
NMR analysis demonstrated Lys73 pKa to be ∼5.2 to 5.6. Together
with previous ultrahigh-resolution crystal structures, these findings
enable us to follow the proton transfer process of the entire acylation
reaction and reveal the critical role of Lys73. They also shed light on
the stability and reversibility of the avibactam carbamoyl acyl–enzyme
complex, highlighting the effect of substrate functional groups in
influencing the protonation states of catalytic residues and subsequently the progression of the reaction.

Although ultrahigh-resolution crystal structures and quantum
mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations have
been carried out on class A β-lactamases, there is not a clear consensus on the acylation mechanism, concerning the proton transfer
from Ser70 ultimately to the leaving group ring nitrogen during the
progression of the acylation reaction and the subsequent transition
into the deacylation step (12, 13). As the acyl–enzyme complex of
class A β-lactamases is the key intermediate in this hydrolysis reaction, a detailed understanding of the molecular interactions in this
complex is essential to elucidating the catalytic mechanism of class
A β-lactamases. For β-lactam substrates, the acyl–enzyme complex
is a transient intermediate. However, the recently developed
β-lactamase inhibitor avibactam traps the enzyme in a stable carbamoyl acyl–enzyme state. Avibactam is a non–β-lactam β-lactamase
inhibitor that exhibits excellent activity against serine β-lactamases
mainly belonging to classes A and C (14–16). It consists of a diazabicyclooctane (DBO) core scaffold that contains an amide group
that reacts with the nucleophilic serine of β-lactamases via a
unique reversible carbamylation/decarbamylation reaction that
allows the inhibitor to be recycled (Fig. 1B) (15–18). A highresolution complex crystal structure of CTX-M-15 with avibactam
revealed valuable information about avibactam inhibition, especially a
Significance
The acid dissociation constant (pKa) and protonation state of
active-site residues plays a critical role in enzyme catalysis.
Elucidating how these properties may be influenced by substrate/inhibitor binding is crucial to a deep understanding of
enzyme function and inhibition. In this study, we focus on class
A β-lactamases, one of the most common mediators of β-lactam
antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacteria. Through a series
of high-resolution crystal structures of the class A β-lactamase
CTX-M-14 in complex with the β-lactamase inhibitor avibactam
at varying pHs, combined with pKa calculations and NMR, we
examine how this inhibitor affects active-site residues’ pKa values and proton transfer. The results offer important insights into
the mechanism of avibactam inhibition and the substrate influence on β-lactamase catalysis.

he β-lactamases are bacterial enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics (1, 2). Class A, C, and D β-lactamases
belong to a broadly diverse family of enzymes known as serine
β-lactamases (3). In contrast, the remaining class B β-lactamases are
metalloenzymes, which require divalent zinc ions for activity (1). Class
A β-lactamases are the most prevalent β-lactamases in multidrugresistant gram-negative bacteria, including the KPC-2 carbapenemase that inactivates nearly all β-lactam compounds, and represent
an important target for antimicrobial drug discovery efforts (1, 4–8).
All class A β-lactamases catalyze β-lactam hydrolysis in a twostep acylation–deacylation reaction (Fig. 1A) (9). Upon the
formation of a precovalent enzyme-substrate complex, the acylation reaction is initiated through a general base-mediated activation of Ser70, which subsequently behaves as nucleophile to
attack the carbonyl carbon of the β-lactam ring to form an acyl–
enzyme intermediate. Concomitantly, a proton is transferred to
the substrate ring nitrogen. For cephalosporins, this proton is
subsequently lost together with the C3 side chain during the ring
isomerization process (10). In the second step of class A β-lactamase
catalysis, the acyl–enzyme intermediate undergoes nucleophilic attack via a general base-activated hydrolytic water molecule, leading
to deacylation and release of a hydrolyzed and inactivated β-lactam
product (9, 11).

protonated Glu166 (16, 19). QM/MM calculations also provided
insights into the free energy landscape underlying the unique
reaction involving β-lactamase and avibactam, where recyclization is favored over hydrolysis (Fig. 1B) (14, 20). However, key
questions, particularly the lack of a clear mechanistic understanding, remain as to why the covalent carbamoyl–ester
bond avibactam forms with serine β-lactamases is very stable
against hydrolysis and why Glu166 remains neutral, despite the
presence of a water molecule perfectly positioned to attack the
covalent bond with the inhibitor and the configuration of activesite residues being almost identical to that in previous β-lactam
acyl–enzyme complexes (16, 18). In comparison, in these other
previously developed β-lactam inhibitors such as cefoxitin complex structures show that the water molecule is displaced or
blocked from attacking the acyl–enzyme linkage (21–25). A deep
understanding of the avibactam inhibition mechanism will be
crucial to the continuing development of DBO-type compounds,
which are currently being intensely studied as new antibacterial
reagents not only against β-lactamases but also against penicillinbinding proteins (PBPs), the original targets of β-lactam antibiotics (26, 27).
In this study, we probed the protonation state and acid dissociation constant (pKa) of Lys73 using high-resolution crystal
structures of the class A β-lactamase CTX-M-14 determined at
both basic and acidic pHs, combined with pKa determination by
NMR. By capturing ligand conformation and protein protonation
state not observed in previous studies, these results have shed
important light on class A β-lactamase acylation and the mechanism of avibactam inhibition, as well as the influence of substrate
functional groups on enzyme catalysis in general.

space group with two molecules in the asymmetric unit (ASU).
Analysis of the Fo – Fc and 2Fo – Fc maps showed three conformations of avibactam (monomer A: conformation 1, 2, and 3 at 0.52,
0.29, and 0.19 occupancy, respectively; monomer B: 0.57, 0.17, and
0.26 occupancy, respectively) (Fig. 2A). The major conformation,
conformation 1, adopts an orientation similar to the previously determined CTX-M-15/avibactam complex (Protein Data Bank [PDB]
ID code 4HBU) (16). Avibactam is covalently attached to the nucleophilic Ser70 residue, where its carbonyl oxygen atom is in the
oxyanion hole formed by the backbone –NH of Ser70 and Ser237. As
expected, the carboxamide group of avibactam is within hydrogen
bond (HB) distance to the side chains of Asn104 (3.0 Å) and Asn132
(2.8 Å). The carboxamide group also forms a weak HB (3.2 Å) with
the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ser237.
One of the most striking differences between the CTX-M-14/
avibactam complex at pH 7.9 and avibactam solved in previously
determined class A β-lactamases (over a range of pHs, from 4.1
to 8.5) is the conformation of the hydroxylamine-O-sulfonate
group. Conformation 1 (refined occupancy: 0.52 [monomer A,
same below]) positions the sulfonate moiety in a binding pocket
to form HBs with the side chains of Thr235 and Ser237 and
electrostatic interactions with Lys234 and Arg276. This is the
same binding pocket that coordinates the C3/C4 carboxylate of
β-lactam substrates (28). The N6 atom of conformation 1 is
forming an HB (2.9 Å) with the side chain of Ser130, which is
hypothesized to serve as the general acid to protonate the substrate leaving nitrogen during avibactam carbamylation or β-lactam
acylation (19). The sulfonate group of conformation 2 (refined
occupancy: 0.29) forms interactions similar to conformation 1 with
Thr235, Ser237, Lys234, and Arg276. However, the sulfonate group
is positioned closer to the Ser130 Oγ (3.3 Å) versus conformation 1
(3.6 Å). In addition, the N6 atom is slightly further away from the
Ser130 Oγ at 3.1 Å. The sulfonate group of conformation 3 (refined
occupancy: 0.19) swings out of the active site, abolishing the HB
contacts with Thr235 and Ser237 and weakening its interactions
with Lys234 and Arg276. In one of the monomers in the ASU, this
new pose allows the sulfonate group to form a potential salt bridge
with Arg222 from the neighboring protein monomer. The N6
atom’s HB with Ser130 Oγ has also been significantly weakened
with the distance between the two groups at 3.3 Å. Overall, the
presence of three conformations of the hydroxylamine-O-sulfonate
group suggests significant flexibility of this moiety, which is most
likely more pronounced at room temperature than the cryogenic
conditions of X-ray diffraction data collection (∼100 K) and may
thus impact its interactions with protein residues. On the protein
side, the binding of avibactam induces a conformational shift in

Tyr105, a residue that has been suggested to play a role in substrate
recognition (Fig. 2B) (29–31). The minor Tyr105 conformation
(refined occupancy: 0.34) has shifted toward the piperidine ring to
form a favorable nonpolar interaction, whereas the major Tyr105
conformation (refined occupancy: 0.66) retains the configuration
usually seen in class A β-lactamases (Fig. 2B) (32). In comparison to
the apo protein and similar to previous observations, Lys73 also
moves away from Glu166 and closer to Ser130 (33, 34).
The 0.83-Å resolution of the CTX-M-14/avibactam complex at
pH 7.9 allowed for the visualization of hydrogen atoms on the
catalytically important residues Lys73, Ser130, and Glu166. The
previously determined CTX-M-15/avibactam complex solved at
1.1 Å shows a protonated and neutral Glu166. However, the
protonation state of Lys73 could not be clearly assigned. Based
on its conformation, Lys73 is within HB distance (2.8 Å) to
Ser130 (16). Our ultrahigh-resolution CTX-M-14/avibactam structure clears the ambiguity surrounding the protonation state of
Lys73. In the structure at a basic pH of 7.9, the omit Fo – Fc
electron density map shows that Lys73 has two protons and is in its
neutral form (Fig. 3). One of the protons on Lys73 is engaged in an
HB (2.9 Å) with the side chain of Asn132. The second proton has
no hydrogen bonding partners with appropriate angles. However,
Lys73Nζ is 2.9 and 3.0 Å away from Ser130O and Ser130C, respectively, and appears to form favorable interactions with π electrons on one side of the planar peptide bond between Ser130 and
Asp131 (Fig. 3). Most importantly, the structure also shows a hydrogen on the Ser130Oγ, which serves as an HB (2.8 Å) donor to
the neutral Lys73. In agreement with the 1.1-Å resolution CTX-M15/avibactam complex, Glu166 is protonated and participates with
Ser70 and Asn170 to coordinate the catalytic water molecule.
Complex crystal structure of avibactam with CTX-M-14 at acidic pHs. To
investigate the influence of the crystallization buffer pH on
the residue protonation states, we prepared the CTX-M-14/
avibactam complex crystal in buffers with pHs 5.3, 6.3, 7.4, 8.4,
and 10. All structures were determined at ∼1-Å resolution and
shared the same active-site configurations as the pH 7.9 complex,
except for the one at pH 5.3. The CTX-M-14/avibactam complex
at pH 5.3 was solved to 1.0-Å resolution with a final Rwork/Rfree
of 0.1420/0.1601 (Fig. 4A). Due to the lower resolution of this
structure, hydrogen atoms were not as visible as in the 0.83-Å
structure. Overall, the CTX-M-14/avibactam complex solved at
pH 5.3 is similar to the CTX-M-14/avibactam complex solved at
pH 7.9, but with some notable changes in the hydrogen bonding
pattern between the inhibitor and active-site residues (Fig. 4B).
The most interesting observation was the presence of a single
inhibitor conformation versus three inhibitor conformations
modeled at the higher pH. Under acidic condition, the negatively
charged hydroxylamine-O-sulfonate group adopts a conformation
that puts it within a hydrogen bonding distance of 2.6 Å to the
hydroxyl side chain of Ser130. Ser130 maintains an HB with Lys73,

with a distance between the two groups now at 3.0 Å versus 2.8 Å in
the pH 7.9 structure. Because the avibactam sulfonate group can
only serve as an HB acceptor, this HB network suggests that Ser130
donates an HB to the sulfonate oxygen and accepts a hydrogen in its
HB with Lys73, reversing the donor/acceptor role compared with
the pH 7.9 structure. Also, we observed that the HB between the
N6 nitrogen and Ser130 had been abolished due to the flipping of
the hydroxylamine-O-sulfonate group, with the side chain Oγ being
3.4 Å away from the N6 nitrogen.
The acyl–enzyme complexes between β-lactamases and avibactam have been studied extensively (18, 35–37). In most previous crystal structures with closely related class A β-lactamases,
similar pH-dependent hydrogen bonding patterns were observed,
that is, an HB between the sulfonate group and Ser130 occurred
at low pH (38, 39) and was abolished at high pH (16). We hypothesize that this change of HB pattern may have originated
from a positively charged Lys73, as compared to a neutral Lys73
observed in the pH 7.9 structure. Lys73 is the only functional
group that can undergo protonation state change in the active
site between pH 7.9 and pH 5.3. Glu166 and Lys234 are both
protonated at pH 7.9, while the pKas of avibactam’s largely
solvent-exposed sulfonate and –NH group are far below pH 5 as
calculated by MarvinSketch, a program commonly used to provide pKa predictions for small molecules (40). As the pH 6.3
structure is identical to the pH 7.9 complex, this indicates the
pKa of Lys73 is likely between pH 5.3 and 6.3, significantly lower
than the estimate of 8.0 to 8.5 in previous studies of β-lactam
hydrolysis (41). Additionally, computational predictions indicated similar disparity in Lys73 pKa between the acyl–enzyme
complexes of avibactam and β-lactam inhibitor cefoxitin (6.24
versus 7.82; SI Appendix, Table S2) (11, 42). Although these
calculations were performed without using thermodynamic integration based on extensive explicit-solvent molecular dynamics
simulations as done by others and were thus less accurate (41),
they suggested that it would be of interest to further probe
Lys73 pKa.
CTX-M lysine protonation state and pKa probed by NMR. We sought to
experimentally determine lysine pKa values using NMR chemical
shifts as an independent observable. The « position of lysines in
particular makes an excellent probe to monitor the protonation
state of lysine side chains, because it lies adjacent to the Nζ
group and therefore changes in Ce chemical shift as a function of
pH report a direct effect of altered Nζ protonation states. For
this experiment, we used a His-tagged CTX-M-9 for the ease of
purification. As described above, CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-9 are
identical to one another in the active-site structure, and the two

proteins exhibit essentially the same biochemical activity (43).
The 1H-13C heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC)
spectrum of free, [13Ce]-Lys selectively labeled CTX-M-9 acquired at pH 5.7 accounts for 9 of the 10 lysines expected based
on the sequence of CTX-M-9 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Addition of
avibactam results in a prominent shift for one of these signals
(K9) and a subtle shift for a set of two signals originating from a
single lysine (K1), while all other signals remain unaffected.
Based on the available structure of the complex between CTXM-14 and avibactam, K9 is therefore tentatively assigned to one
of Lys73 and Lys234, the two lysines lining the catalytic site of
CTX-M enzymes (Fig. 2A). From the pH dependence of the 13C
chemical shifts for signals K1 through K9 (Fig. 5 and SI Appendix, Fig. S1B), it is evident that signal K9 corresponds to a
lysine with a pKa of 5.2 ± 0.2, which is in agreement with the
deprotonated state of Lys73 observed in the pH >5.3 structures,
while all other signals correspond to pKa values greater than
10.0. To obtain site-specific information we also monitored the
pH dependence of the Cα–Hα groups. Although the chemical
shifts of the Cα–Hα group are not as sensitive to Nζ deprotonation as of the Ce–He group, detection of even small chemical
shift changes that report coincidental pH titration curves, and
thus pKa values, can be used to assign these pKa values to specific residues. Assignment for the Cα of Lys73 was obtained in a
sequential manner using a set of triple resonance experiments,
while the position of its Cα–Hα on a 1H-13C HSQC was identified again through a comparison with the spectrum of free CTXM-9 acquired at the same pH (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Using the
pH dependence of the Hα chemical shift as a reporter, a pKa of
5.6 ± 0.2 is obtained for Lys73, which is consistent with the pKa
determined using the Ce chemical shift, as well as the pHdependent crystal structures.
Mechanism of proton transfer in class A β-lactamases catalysis. The highresolution crystal structures of class A β-lactamases trapped with
avibactam have allowed us to visualize the protonation states of
key catalytic residues in the acyl–enzyme complex of a wild-type
class A β-lactamase. Together with previous subangstrom-resolution
crystal structures, we can now track the changes of residue protonation states throughout the entire acylation process and gain deep
insights into the proton transfer mechanism of these enzymes (Fig.
6). In combination with the biochemical analyses and the QM/MM
calculations by Mobashery and coworkers (44), these data demonstrate the central role of Lys73, acting concertedly with Glu166, in
activating both Ser70 in the acylation step and subsequently the
catalytic water in the deacylation reaction.
In the apo protein, both Lys73 and Glu166 are charged (Fig. 6,
stage I). The binding of the substrate initiates proton transfers
from Ser70 to the catalytic water and from the water to Glu166.
Both experimental and computational data suggest that a third,
at least partial proton transfer also takes place between the
positively charged Lys73 and the negatively charged Ser70, before the formation of the transition state (TS). In the QM/MM
calculations, a complete proton transfer leads to a neutral Lys73
and a neutral Ser70, enabling Lys73 to be the general base for
the acylation reaction (Fig. 6, stage II) (44). Meanwhile, in a
noncovalent complex crystal structure with CTX-M-14, a lowbarrier HB (LBHB) is observed between Lys73 and Ser70, with
an HB length of 2.53 Å and the hydrogen atom equally shared
between the two (45).
An LBHB is a special type of HB occurring between polar
functional groups with comparable pKas and has been proposed
to play an important role in enzyme catalysis, including general
acid/base catalysis due to their extraordinary strength compared
with standard HBs (46–49). An LBHB between Lys73 and Ser70
can significantly lower the energy of the TS, allowing Lys73 to
carry out the role of a general base where the proton transfer is
en route at the acylation TS (Fig. 6, state III). In comparison, the
deprotonation of Ser70 by Glu166 and the catalytic water is most

to the presence of other ionizable groups in its vicinity (SI Appendix, Fig.

likely completed before the TS. The hydrogen shared between
Lys73 and Ser70 is ultimately transferred to Lys73, resulting
again in a positively charged Lys73 during the collapse of the
acylation TS (Fig. 6, stage III), as shown by the 0.83-Å-resolution
crystal structure of CTX-M-14 with a boronic acid TS analog
(45). In this TS analog structure, both Lys234 and Lys73 serve as
HB donors to Ser130, which in turn donates a hydrogen in an HB
with the boronic acid oxygen mimicking the ring nitrogen. The
structures of the TS analog and of our latest avibactam complex
captures the stages immediately before and after the proton
transfer from Ser130 to the ring nitrogen, respectively (Fig. 6,

by red dashed lines). The shared proton of the LBHB is subsequently transferred to Lys73, which protonates Ser130 after the serine residue transfers its own
proton to the ring nitrogen atom. Isomerization of the cephalosporin dihydrothiazine ring results in cleavage of the C3 side chain, a reaction unique for many
cephalosporins. (IV) A neutral Lys73 takes a proton from Glu166. A negatively charged Glu166 serves as the base for the deacylation process and activates the
catalytic water molecule for its attack on the acyl–enzyme linkage. (V) Lys73 protonates Ser70 during the collapse of the tetrahedral deacylation TS and then
takes a proton from Glu166. (VI) The protonation states of Lys73 and Glu166 return to those of the free enzyme, and the hydrolyzed product is released.

stages III and IV). Whereas it has been debated whether Lys234
or Lys73 replenishes the proton on Ser130 (50), our structure
clearly shows that it is the latter. In addition, the avibactam
structure supports previous QM/MM calculations showing that a
neutral Lys73 is also in a commanding position to initiate the
deacylation process by activating Glu166 (Fig. 6, state IV) (44),
although the proton transfer from Glu166 to Lys73 is impeded in
the avibactam complex (51). For β-lactam substrates, a negatively charged Glu166 would then deprotonate the catalytic water, which attacks and cleaves the acyl–enzyme linkage. This
results in a second tetrahedral TS where Lys73 protonates Ser70
while taking a proton from Glu166 (Fig. 6, state V). The collapse
of this deacylation TS leads to the formation of the hydrolyzed
product and the regeneration of the free enzyme (Fig. 6, state VI).
Class A β-lactamases have evolved from PBPs, acquiring
Glu166 to help catalyze the deacylation reaction (52–54). Previous subangstrom-resolution acyl–enzyme and product complex
structures using E166A mutants demonstrate a similar HB network involving the substrate, Ser130 and Lys73 (Fig. 7A) (11,
55). Together with the apo PBP structures, they suggest that
Lys73 may play a similar role in the β-lactam acylation process in
PBPs in the absence of Glu166.

Compared with β-lactam substrates, the acyl–enzyme complexes
of avibactam and β-lactamases are more stable against hydrolysis.
This originates at least partially from the chemical difference of
the two acyl–enzyme linkages, a carbamoyl for avibactam and an
ester for β-lactams (38). However, previous QM/MM calculations
also suggest that in the acyl–enzyme complex with avibactam, the
proton transfer from Glu166 to Lys73 has an activation barrier of
∼30 kcal/mol (51), in comparison to a spontaneous and barrierless
process in the complexes with β-lactam substrates (44). The higher
proton transfer barrier could make it more difficult for Lys73 to
activate Glu166, and subsequently the catalytic water, for the
deacylation reaction. Our analyses provide a mechanistic understanding for this difference between avibactam and β-lactams.

Influence of substrate on catalytic residue pKa and enzymatic reaction.

The pKa of the catalytic residues in class A β-lactamases has
been studied both experimentally and computationally using
TEM-1 as a model system (34, 41, 44, 56). It is hypothesized that
the binding of a β-lactam substrate can influence the pKa of
active-site residues. Although earlier computational studies did
not show such effect (41), it was later supported by the protonation state changes of Lys73 and Glu166 upon ligand binding,
captured by both computational and experimental studies, as
described above (11, 44, 45). Our studies herein have shed
light on how the deacylation process can also be subjected to the
influence of substrate/inhibitor functional groups on catalytic
residue pKa.

Conclusion
The 0.83-Å-resolution complex crystal structure of CTX-M-14
and avibactam captures the acyl–enzyme at a state where both
Lys73 and Glu166 are neutral. Compared with β-lactam acyl–
enzyme complexes, the proton transfer from Glu166 to Lys73 is
hindered by avibactam. Based on multiple crystals at both basic
and acidic pHs, as well as computations and NMR, our results
suggest that the unique hydroxylamine-O-sulfonate side chain of
Pemberton et al.

avibactam may perturb the pKa of Lys73 differently than the C3/
4 carboxylate group of β-lactam compounds, making Lys73 a
weaker base in the avibactam acyl–enzyme complex. By elucidating the residue protonation states of a key intermediate of
class A β-lactamase catalysis, these studies offer important insights into the proton transfer mechanism of β-lactam hydrolysis
and the influence of substrate functional groups on the progression of enzymatic reactions in general. In particular, together
with previous results, we now have a complete experimental picture of the central role of Lys73, acting concertedly with Glu166,
in activating both the acylation and deacylation steps of the reaction, as suggested by previous QM/MM calculations (44). Finally, whereas X-ray crystallography, computational predictions
and NMR are in overall agreement about Lys73 pKa in the avibactam complex, future investigation into the small differences
among these methods, especially by using more sophisticated
calculations, will offer additional insights into the interpretation of
residue protonation states in crystal structures and the development
of new computational approaches.
Materials and Methods
Construct Design. The CTX-M-14 gene (residues 23 to 284) was cloned into a
modified plasmid vector pET-9a. The ligation product was transformed into
NEB 5-alpha–competent Escherichia coli and plated onto lysogeny broth (LB)
agar containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin. A single colony was isolated and
grown overnight at 37 °C in LB media containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin. Cells
were harvested, and plasmid DNA was obtained using a miniprep kit. The
CTX-M-14 gene sequence was verified.
Protein Expression and Purification. BL21(DE3) E. coli cells transformed with
the plasmid pET-blaCTX-M-14 were cultured in LB broth containing kanamycin at 100 μg/mL at 37 °C for 5 h. Overexpression of CTX-M-14 was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight
at 20 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min at
4 °C) and then disrupted by ultrasonic treatment (four times for 30 s, each
time at 20 W). The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 60
min at 4 °C. After addition of 2 μg of DNase I (Roche), the supernatant was
dialyzed overnight against 20 mM MES–NaOH (pH 6.0). The purification was
carried out by ion-exchange chromatography on a fast-flow CM column
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0) and eluted
with a linear 0 to 0.15 M NaCl gradient. The enzyme was more than 95%
homogeneous as judged by Coomassie blue staining after sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified protein was dialyzed
against 5 mM Tri·HCl buffer (pH 7.0) and concentrated to 20 mg/mL for
crystallization.
Protein Crystallization. CTX-M-14 crystals were grown in 1.0 M potassium
phosphate. A 200 mM stock of avibactam in dimethyl sulfoxide was used to
make a soaking solution of 5 mM avibactam in 1.0 M potassium phosphate.
Crystals were soaked for 30 min in different pH ranges then cryoprotected
with 1.0 M potassium phosphate and 30% (wt/vol) sucrose before flash cooling
in liquid nitrogen.
Data Collection and Structure Determination. Data for the CTX-M-14 avibactam complex structures were collected at the Advanced Photon Source
beamlines SBC 19-ID-D and GM/CA 23-ID-B. Diffraction data were indexed
and integrated with iMosflm (58) or HKL2000 (59) and scaled with Aimless
(60) from the CCP4 suite (61) or HKL2000. Phasing was performed using
molecular replacement with the program Phaser (62). Structure refinement
was performed using phenix.refine (63) of the PHENIX suite (64) and model
building in WinCoot (65). The program eLBOW in PHENIX was used to obtain
geometry restraint information (66). For data collection and refinement
statistics see SI Appendix, Table S1.
Protein Expression and Purification for NMR. Isotopically labeled CTX-M-9 for
NMR measurements was expressed from a pODc29 vector encoding for an Nterminal His-tag using BL21(DE3) E. coli cells. U-[13C/15N] labeling was performed in M9 media supplemented with U-13C glucose and 15N-NH4Cl as the
sole carbon and nitrogen source. Protein expression was induced at an optical
density at 600 nm of ∼0.7 by the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG and was allowed to
proceed overnight at 20 °C. Selectively [13Ce]- or U-[13C]-Lys–labeled CTX-M-9
was produced in unlabeled M9. The [13Ce]- or U-[13C]–labeled lysine was added

BIOCHEMISTRY

We propose that the proton transfer is impaired due to the
particular properties of avibactam’s hydroxylamine-O-sulfonate
side chain, compared with β-lactams, through both direct influence of electrostatic interactions and indirect effect via Ser130.
Lys73Nζ is ∼5 to 6 Å away from the negatively charged oxygen
atoms of Glu166 and β-lactam C3/4 carboxylate group in the
acyl–enzyme complex (Fig. 7). Previous studies have shown that
the introduction of Glu166 increases the pKa of Lys73 from 6 to
8, making it a stronger base (41, 44, 50, 57). The β-lactam carboxylate group is likely to have a similar effect on Lys73 pKa, but
such influence by the avibactam sulfonate would be significantly
diminished. Both the β-lactam carboxylate group and the avibactam sulfonate group have one net negative charge, distributed between the two oxygen atoms of a carboxylate group, and
the three oxygens in the sulfonate group. Comparing the major
conformation of the avibactam crystal structure with β-lactam
complexes, the sulfonate group is more solvent-exposed, which
could further affect the localization of the negative charge (Fig.
7). Furthermore, the position of the avibactam sulfonate group
in the active site is relatively unstable due to the flexibility of the
hydroxylamine chain. Most notably, in the avibactam complex
structure, one of the sulfonate conformations resides outside the
active-site pocket and away from Lys73. Such a conformation
further decreases the electrostatic influence of the sulfonate
charge on Lys73 and is mostly likely much more dominant at
37 °C in solution compared with −170 °C cryogenic conditions
and the crystalline environment. All these effects could potentially reduce the influence of the sulfonate group on the pKa of
Lys73, compared with the β-lactam carboxylate group.
Aside from direct electrostatic influence, the ligand may affect
Lys73 pKa through Ser130. In the avibactam conformation
with the sulfonate inside the active site, the N6 nitrogen of the
hydroxylamine-O-sulfonate group functions as a HB donor in its
interaction with Ser130, which in turn donates a hydrogen in its
HB with Lys73. Such interactions may also favor a neutral Lys73,
particularly considering the N6 hydrogen may have more positive
partial charge than the β-lactam ring –NH group in acyl–enzyme
complexes with penicillins or monobactams. In acyl–enzyme complexes with cephalosporins, the ring nitrogen loses the hydrogen
during dihydrothiazine ring isomerization (Fig. 6, step III). Interestingly, in the acyl–enzyme complexes of Toho-1 E166A mutant Lys73 adopts two conformations in the cefotaxime complex
lacking the HB between the ring nitrogen and Ser130 (55), in
comparison to one conformation for the penicillin-G (31) and
aztreonam (11) structures with such an HB. Similar observations
were also made in the CTX-M-9 acyl–enzyme complex structure
with cefoxitin, a cephalosporin, suggesting a potential influence of
the substrate –NH group on Lys73 through Ser130, particularly in
the avibactam complex (21, 56). Similarly, the avibactam sulfonate
group and the β-lactam carboxylate moiety can potentially affect
the position of the hydrogen on the Ser130 hydroxyl group to
varied extents, and indirectly influence Lys73 pKa as well, as
demonstrated by the different hydrogen bonding network involving the sulfonate group, Ser130, and Lys73 in the avibactam
complex crystal structures determined at different pHs. Taken
together, the charge distribution, flexibility, and HB capability of
the avibactam side chain may ultimately be responsible for perturbing Lys73’s pKa, making it an unfavorable process to accept a
proton from Glu166.

15 min prior to induction and overexpression was allowed to proceed for 3 h
at 20 °C. Cells were resuspended in 20 mM Tris, pH 8.4, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM
imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and lysed by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and loaded on a Ni Sepharose
column. After extensive washing the protein was eluted in the same buffer at
a 400 mM imidazole concentration and the tag was removed by tobacco etch
virus cleavage and a second affinity column. The protein was finally purified
through a Superdex 200 gel-filtration column.

NMR Spectroscopy. NMR pH titrations of avibactam-bound [13Ce]- or U-[13C]–
labeled CTX-M-9 were followed by acquiring 1H-13C HSQC spectra; 14 pH
points were acquired for the [13Ce]-Lys–labeled (4.5, 4.9, 5.3, 5.7, 6.1, 6.5, 6.9,
7.3, 7.7, 8.1, 9.1, 10.1, 11.1, and 12.1) and 13 pH points (4.5, 5.1, 5.7, 6.3, 6.9,
7.5, 8.1, 8.7, 9.3, 9.9, 10.65, 11.7, and 12.3) for the U-[13C]-Lys–labeled sample. Sequence-specific backbone resonance assignment of CTX-M-9 in the
avibactam-bound state at pH 5.5 was transferred from a partial resonance
assignment of free CTX-M-9 obtained at the same pH, using a set of HNCA
and HNCOCA experiments. pKa values were calculated by three-parameter
least-square fitting of the chemical shift data (δobs) obtained from the titration experiments into the following equation:
δobs = δU +
