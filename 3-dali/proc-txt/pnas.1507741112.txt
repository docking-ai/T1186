With few exceptions, all living organisms encode the same 20
canonical amino acids; however, it remains an open question whether
organisms with additional amino acids beyond the common 20 might
have an evolutionary advantage. Here, we begin to test that notion
by making a large library of mutant enzymes in which 10 structurally
distinct noncanonical amino acids were substituted at single sites
randomly throughout TEM-1 β-lactamase. A screen for growth on the
β-lactam antibiotic cephalexin afforded a unique p-acrylamido-phenylalanine (AcrF) mutation at Val-216 that leads to an increase in
catalytic efficiency by increasing kcat, but not significantly affecting
KM. To understand the structural basis for this enhanced activity, we
solved the X-ray crystal structures of the ligand-free mutant enzyme
and of the deacylation-defective wild-type and mutant cephalexin
acyl-enzyme intermediates. These structures show that the Val-216–
AcrF mutation leads to conformational changes in key active site
residues—both in the free enzyme and upon formation of the acylenzyme intermediate—that lower the free energy of activation of
the substrate transacylation reaction. The functional changes induced by this mutation could not be reproduced by substitution
of any of the 20 canonical amino acids for Val-216, indicating that
an expanded genetic code may offer novel solutions to proteins
as they evolve new activities.

ith the rare exceptions of pyrrolysine and selenocysteine,
all known organisms use the same 20 canonical amino
acids to carry out their life functions. However, additional regulatory, catalytic, and structural elements have evolved that include
organic/inorganic cofactors and posttranslational modifications
that expand the structural and functional repertoire of protein
sequence space (1, 2). The question arises as to why the genetic
code has remained virtually constant over evolution, given that
relatively few genes are required to add additional building blocks
to the code. All that is necessary is an additional cognate tRNA/
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) pair that is orthogonal to the
existing pairs in the host (i.e., does not cross-react with endogenous tRNA/aaRS pairs), selectively recognizes a noncanonical
amino acid (ncAA), and uniquely inserts that amino acid into
the growing polypeptide chain in response to a nonsense or
frameshift codon (3, 4). Indeed, pyrrolysine itself is genetically
encoded by an orthogonal amber suppressor tRNA/aaRS pair,
and we and others have shown that a large number of ncAAs
with unique chemical and physical properties can be added to
the genetic codes of prokaryotes with little effect on growth rates
under normal laboratory growth conditions (3–6). This expanded
genetic code now allows one to begin to explore the potential impact of additional building blocks on protein structure and function.
A number of experimental systems have been reported that
begin to explore this question. For example, an in vitro antibody
phage display system was developed in which sulfo-tyrosine–containing antibodies outcompeted others in affinity-based panning
for binding to gp120, an HIV protein that naturally binds the
sulfated cytokine receptor CCR5 (7). A similar phage display
www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1507741112

system was used to select a Zn(II) finger transcription factor in which
the Zn(II) site was replaced with a unique 4-bipyridylalanine·Fe(II)
site with no impact on DNA affinity and selectivity (8). A selection
system based on survival of Escherichia coli in response to proteolytic
stress afforded ribosomal cyclic peptides that contain a keto amino
acid and covalently bind and inactivate HIV protease (9). Recently,
it was shown that substitution of 3-iodo-tyrosine in the type II holin
protein of bacteriophage T7 leads to increased phage fitness
(10). Here we describe an alternative approach to explore the
possible effects of additional building blocks on protein structure
and function in which we generated a large library of β-lactamase
variants with distinct ncAAs substituted randomly at single sites
throughout the protein (Fig. 1A). We then used this system to
identify an enzyme with increased catalytic efficiency that stems
from conformational effects on key active site residues resulting
from mutation of Val-216 to p-acrylamido-phenylalanine (AcrF).
Results
Generation of a β-Lactamase Library Containing ncAAs. Bacterial resistance to expanded-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics has attracted
considerable interest, and multidrug-resistant bacteria have resulted
in an increasing number of hospital infections. A major mechanism
for this resistance is the enzyme β-lactamase. To date, >200
β-lactamase mutants have been found to arise by mutations from
class-A β-lactamases, such as TEM and SHV (11). In an effort
to determine whether an expanded genetic code might provide

Significance
We describe a general strategy that begins to allow us to address the question of whether an expanded genetic code provides an evolutionary advantage to an organism. A large library
of β-lactamase variants with distinct noncanonical amino acids
substituted randomly at single sites throughout the protein was
generated and then subjected to an antibiotic growth-based
screen to identify mutants with enhanced catalytic activity. We
show that a unique noncanonical mutation in the enzyme
β-lactamase significantly increases catalytic activity by unexpected
mechanisms. These effects cannot be recapitulated by other canonical amino acids at this site, suggesting that an expanded set
of building blocks beyond the canonical 20 may offer unique solutions to organisms in the evolution of new functions.

Fig. 1. ncAA mutagenesis and a growth-based screen. (A) The TAG-scanned library was transformed into cells expressing a polyspecific amber suppressor
tRNA/aaRS pair. The growth-based screen was carried out with various ncAAs, and the mutated residues within the target gene were determined by sequence
analysis. (B) The structures of ncAAs used in this study. Suppression efficiencies of tRNACUATyr/PolyRS pair in the absence and presence of various amino acids
were evaluated by using a GFP-based assay.

an evolutionary advantage to β-lactamases in adapting to new
β-lactam antibiotics, we generated a large library of point mutants
in which a number of different ncAAs were randomly substituted
at each of 144 of the 286 residues in TEM-1 β-lactamase. These
residues were chosen based on the X-ray crystal structure to include residues located in the active-site region and positions
previously reported to be critical for enzyme function (12).
To simplify construction of a β-lactamase library containing a
variety of structurally distinct ncAAs, a polyspecific aminoacyltRNA synthetase (PolyRS) was used that is orthogonal to the
endogenous translational machinery of E. coli and that selectively incorporates ncAAs and not any of the canonical 20 amino
acids in response to the amber nonsense codon. A fluorescencebased screen was first used to determine the suppression efficiency and polyspecificity of this aaRS for a set of substituted
aromatic amino acid side chains, (because PolyRS is derived
from a Methanococcus jannaschii tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase) (Fig.
1B). This screen was accomplished by growing DH10B cells
containing the amber suppressor tRNA/PolyRS pair (encoded
on the plasmid pUltra-Poly) and a superfolder green fluorescent
protein (sfGFP) with an amber mutation at the permissive site
Tyr-151 (encoded on plasmid pET22b-T5-sfGFP*) in LB medium supplemented with various ncAAs at a concentration of 1 mM
(Fig. 1B) (13, 14). The highest GFP expression levels were observed
in the presence of 10 derivatives of tyrosine or phenylalanine,
including p-acetyl-phenylalanine (AcF), O-methyl-tyrosine, AcrF,
p-azido-phenylalanine (AzF), O-allyl-tyrosine (O-allyl-Y), p-bromophenylalanine (BrF), p-iodo-phenylalanine (IF), p-azidomethylphenylalanine (AzMeF), p-biphenylalanine, and O-tert-butyl-tyrosine (Fig. 1B). These 10 amino acids were subsequently used in
growth-based screens with the initial β-lactamase library.
A Growth-Based Screen for β-Lactamase Variants with Enhanced
Activity. To generate TEM-1 β-lactamase mutants containing these

ncAAs, a TAG nonsense codon was introduced independently at
each of 144 sites by site-directed mutagenesis and verified by sequencing. This TAG-scanned library was then introduced into
E. coli DH10B cells containing the amber suppressor tRNA/PolyRS
pair (Fig. 1A), and the transformed cells were subjected to selective

pressure in the presence and absence of the 10 ncAAs with the
expanded spectrum β-lactam antibiotics cephalexin or ceftazidime
(Fig. 2A). To our delight, hundreds of colonies were observed on the
plate with 3 μg·mL−1 ceftazidime in the presence of AzMeF,
AcF, AzF, O-allyl-Y, BrF, or IF after 2 d. Notably, no colonies
were observed on the plates with 3 μg·mL−1 ceftazidime in the
absence of the ncAAs. Sequencing of 10 individual colonies on
each plate revealed a unique mutation (Asp-179–TAG). The
presence of the Asp-179–AzMeF mutation resulted in a significantly higher ceftazidime minimal inhibitory concentration
(MIC) (14 μg·mL−1), compared with the wild-type β-lactamase
(0.25 μg·mL−1) (Table S1). The X-ray crystal structure of wildtype β-lactamase shows that the guanidinium side chain of Arg164 is hydrogen-bonded to Asp-179 in the omega loop near the
active site (15). Previous studies have demonstrated that loss of this
hydrogen bond by point mutation (Asp-179–Asn) may weaken
the omega loop, which makes it possible for the enzyme to accommodate bulkier substrates (16, 17).
A Novel β-Lactamase Mutant with Increased Catalytic Efficiency. Although the above result provided validation for this experimental
approach, both canonical and ncAAs led to increased activity
when substituted for Asp-179 (Table S1). We therefore carried
out additional experiments to identify enzymes with improved
activity that results only from mutation to a ncAA. Using a similar
growth-based screen with the β-lactam antibiotic cephalexin, we
identified a Val-216 to AcrF mutant with a significantly higher
MIC (90 μg·mL−1) than the wild-type enzyme (10 μg·mL−1). This
substitution was shown to be AcrF-dependent, because β-lactamases with Val-216 mutated to the other nine ncAAs have MICs
for cephalexin that are less than or equal that of the wild-type
enzyme (Table S2). To determine whether the enhanced activity
resulting from the Val-216–AcrF substitution could be recapitulated
by any of the canonical amino acids, we independently mutated Val216 to the other 19 canonical amino acids. The most active variant
(Val-216–Ile) within this pool had at most a twofold higher MIC
(20 μg·mL−1) than the wild-type enzyme (10 μg·mL−1); the MICs of
the other mutants were comparable to or lower than the wild-type
enzyme (Fig. 2B).
Xiao et al.

To further assess the effect of the Val-216–AcrF mutation on
enzymic activity against cephalexin, the kinetic parameters were
determined for the wild-type and mutant enzymes (Fig. 2C) (18).
Wild-type β-lactamase and β-lactamases bearing canonical mutations were prepared as described in the previous study (19). For
the Val-216–AcrF variant, pET30b-T5-TEM1-216TAG containing
a TEM-1 variant with a C-terminal His6 tag and an amber codon
at Val-216 was cotransformed with the tRNA/PolyRS pair (in the
pUltra expression vector) into E. coli DH10B cells. The expression
of the Val-216–AcrF enzyme was carried out in rich medium in the
presence of 1 mM AcrF, and protein was purified by Ni-NTA and
ion-exchange chromatography. Electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS
analysis of proteins confirmed the site-specific incorporation of
mutations and the homogeneity of purified enzymes (Fig. S1). The
Val-216–AcrF enzyme exhibited a significantly increased kcat (14fold) and a slightly increased KM (twofold) for cephalexin hydrolysis
compared with those values observed for the wild-type enzyme (Fig.
2C). Among the canonical amino acids, phenylalanine and tyrosine
are most closely related to AcrF. The Val-216–Tyr and –Phe mutants exhibited a slight decrease in kcat/KM compared with the wildtype enzyme; the most active canonical amino acid mutant (Val216–Ile) showed a comparable kcat/KM compared with the wild-type
enzyme (Fig. 2C). Thus, none of the Val-216–X canonical or noncanonical mutants could recapitulate the functional change
imparted by the AcrF mutation.
Structural Analysis of β-Lactamase Variants. Val-216 lies near the
active site, but has not been implicated in playing a role in catalysis. To explore the mechanistic basis for the increase in catalytic activity resulting from the Val-216–AcrF substitution,
the crystal structure of the Val-216–AcrF mutant enzyme was
obtained at 1.54-Å resolution by molecular replacement (Fig. 3D).

Discussion
Proteins are innately flexible, undergoing dynamic conformational changes over a wide range of time regimes and amplitudes.
Previous studies have shown that changes in the energetics of
specific conformational states of proteins cannot affect only
binding affinity, but also catalytic efficiency (25–30). Early work
demonstrated that some enzymes bind their substrates by an induced-fit mechanism in which active residues adopt distinct conformations upon substrate binding (25, 31, 32). More recent structural
and spectroscopic studies have also shown that reduction in the

ligand-free TEM-1 β-lactamase structure [Protein Data Bank
(PDB) ID code 1BTL] showed a number of conformational
changes in some surface residues (e.g., Glu-140, Glu-240, and
Arg-241), which are observed in other structures. More relevant is a
side-chain reorientation of Tyr-105 in the free Val-216–AcrF
mutant to a minus (m-85°/m-30°) rotamer (Fig. 3D), relative to
its conformation in the free wild-type enzyme and the benzylpenicillin acyl-enzyme intermediate, where Tyr-105 adopts a
trans (t-80°) rotamer (Fig. 3 A and B) (12, 20, 21). This conformational change likely relieves possible steric interactions between
Tyr-105 and the acrylamido moiety of AcrF. In the class A β-lactamases, Tyr-105 is a conserved residue that lies at the entrance to
the active site. Saturation mutagenesis studies have suggested that
Tyr-105 may play a role in substrate discrimination and binding
(22). Interestingly, the minus (m-85°/m-30°) rotamer orientation of
Tyr-105 is observed in the crystal structures of the wild-type enzyme
complexes with boronic acid transition state inhibitors or the natural
protein inhibitors BLIP I and BLIP II. This observation suggests
that the minus conformation of Tyr-105 may also stabilize the
transition state for the transacylation of cephalexin, resulting in
an increased kcat (20, 23, 24). In contrast, in the wild-type enzyme,
Tyr-105 is fixed in a trans configuration in the free enzyme (Fig. 3
A and B), and there would be a free energy cost associated with
movement of this side chain to the minus conformer upon formation of the enzyme–cephalexin transition state complex (Fig.
3 A and C).
To support this hypothesis, we crystallized the acyl-enzyme
intermediate of a deacylation-defective β-lactamase in which
cephalexin is covalently bound to the catalytic serine residue of
the wild-type or Val-216–AcrF enzyme. Previously, the crystal
structure of a Glu-166–Asn deacylation-defective TEM-1 β-lactamase mutant was solved with a benzylpenicillin bound acylenzyme intermediate (12). Using a similar approach, we were
able to cocrystallize and solve the structures of a Glu-166–Asn
mutant of wild-type β-lactamase (1.80-Å resolution) and a Glu166–Ala mutant of the Val-216–AcrF mutant (1.70-Å resolution), both with cephalexin covalently bound to Ser-70 (12, 15).
Indeed, in both structures, Tyr-105 adopts the m rotamer, which
results in a favorable end-on stacking interaction with the benzyl
moiety of the cephalexin acyl-enzyme intermediate (Fig. 3 C and
E). In addition the m rotamer likely relieves possible unfavorable
steric interactions of Tyr-105 with the bulkier dihydrothiazine
ring of the antibiotic (Fig. 3 C and E). Thus, the wild-type enzyme
must pay an energetic price to reorient Tyr-105 for hydrolysis of
cephalexin, whereas in the Val-216–AcrF mutant the same m
rotamer of Tyr-105 is observed in both the ligand-free enzyme
and the cephalexin acyl-enzyme intermediate (Fig. 3 D–F). In
addition, a comparison of the structures of the free and cephalexin
acyl-enzyme mutant enzymes shows that the side chain of AcrF–
216 undergoes a significant conformational change during the
catalytic reaction that leads to improve packing interactions
with cephalexin in the acyl-enzyme intermediate (Fig. 3 F and I).
This change in the conformation of AcrF between the free enzyme
and acyl-enzyme intermediate appears to occur by an induced-fit
mechanism, although it is not clear whether this conformational
change occurs upon substrate binding or upon formation of the
covalent adduct (Fig. 3 G–I).

conformational plasticity of germ-line antibodies by somatic mutation results in increased affinity for the cognate antigen (29, 33,
34). In the enzyme cyclophilin A, it has been shown that mutations, which alter the conformational equilibrium of catalytically active and inactive states, affect catalytic efficiency (35). In
addition, structural and dynamic studies of dihydrofolate reductase
have shown that mutations that affect millisecond-time-scale fluctuations lead to decreased rates of hydride transfer (36). Similarly,
crystallographic analysis and microsecond-scale molecular-dynamics simulations have suggested that remote mutations in simvastatin
synthase alter catalytic efficiency through conformational effects
(37). Other examples include the demonstration of altered catalytic activity in conformational isomers of a catalytic antibody and
the effects of distal mutations on HIV protease active-site conformation and catalytic activity (38).
Herein we show that a unique noncanonical mutation (Val-216–
AcrF) in the enzyme TEM-1 β-lactamase significantly increases
catalytic activity by affecting the conformational energetics of key
active-site residues. Hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics by the classA β-lactamases involves a two-step pathway: transacylation to
form an acyl-enzyme intermediate and deacylation by attack of
water (12). Fluorescence and mass spectral kinetic studies have
suggested that the enzyme–substrate transacylation reaction is
the rate-limiting step for hydrolysis of first-generation cephalosporins (39, 40). In all previously reported free enzyme structures,
Tyr-105 which is in the active site but has not been implicated to
play a role in catalysis, has been assigned to the trans rotamer. Our
results show that the noncanonical mutation Val-216–AcrF induces
6964 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1507741112

a conformational change in Tyr-105 to the minus rotamer in both
the free enzyme and acyl-enzyme intermediate, which results in
improved packing interactions with the acyl-enzyme intermediate.
Furthermore, the cephalexin acyl-enzyme intermediate reveals additional favorable packing interactions between the AcrF side chain
and the thiazine ring and benzyl group of cephalexin, which occur
by a change in the side-chain conformation of AcrF relative to the
free enzyme. Together, these results support the notion that the
Val-216–AcrF mutation increases kcat for hydrolysis of cephalexin
through conformational changes in both Tyr-105 and AcrF itself
that may lower the activation energy of the cephalexin transacylation reaction. Whether these interactions lower the free
energy of activation by stabilizing the tetrahedral transition state
or by introducing strain into the ground-state complex cannot be
determined at present. However, the X-ray crystal structure of
boronic acid transition-state analogs bound to the enzyme do
show Tyr-105 in the same minus conformation that is present in
the cephalexin acyl-enzyme intermediate of the Val-216–AcrF mutant, and the mutation does not show any significant effect on
substrate KM (23, 41, 42). A comparison of the structures of the
mutant and WT enzyme reveals no significant change in the position of the catalytic water molecule, supporting the notion that the
Val-216–AcrF mutation primarily affects the first step of the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction.
Although one cannot exclude the possibility that canonical
mutations at other sites might have a similar effect to the Val216–AcrF mutation, substitution of any canonical amino acids at
residue 216 does not significantly affect the catalytic efficiency

yeast–tryptone (YT) were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Isopropyl-β-Dthiogalactoside (IPTG) was purchased from Anatrace, and 4–12% (wt/vol)
Bis-Tris gels for SDS/PAGE were purchased from Invitrogen. DNA polymerase
was obtained from Agilent Technologies, dNTPs were obtained from New
England Biolabs, and oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA
Technologies (Tables S3 and S4 list the oligonucleotides used in this report).
Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from NEB. Ceftazidime, cephalexin, cefaclor, and cefradine were obtained from Research
Products International Corp., Alfa Aesar, Enzo Life Sciences, and Alfa Aesar,
respectively. Plasmid DNA preparation was carried out with the QIAprep
Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). Unless otherwise mentioned, all other chemicals
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.
AcrF was synthesized as described (47). Absorbance spectra were measured
with a Hewlett-Packard 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer.
Construction of TAG-Scanned Library. To construct the TAG-scanned library,
the WT TEM-1 gene cassette was generated by PCR using primers HX0975 and
HX096, and the pBK vector was amplified by using primers HX0976 and
HX0977. The WT TEM-1 gene was inserted into the pBK vector by Gibson
assembly cloning to provide pBK-wtTEM1. From this plasmid, TEM-1 gene
variants bearing TAG mutation were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis
using the QuikChange Site Directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies)
and the primers listed in Table S3. These individual mutants were sequenced
and combined in a pool to yield the TAG-scanned library (Table S3).
Construction of Expression Vectors. The WT TEM-1 gene cassette was generated by PCR using primers HX1034 and HX1035 and inserted into pET30b by
using NdeI and KpnI sites to provide pET30b-T5-wtTEM1. From this plasmid,
pET30b-T5-TEM1-216TAG was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using
the QuikChange Site Directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) and the
following primers: HX1057 and HX1058. pET30b-T5-TEM1-216Phe, pET30bT5-TEM1-216Tyr, pET30b-T5-TEM1-216Leu, and pET30b-T5-TEM1-216Ile were

HX1063 and HX1064, HX1067 and HX1068, HX1069, and HX1070, respectively
(Table S4).
Determination of PolyRS Polyspecificity. The pET22b-T5-sfGFP* and pUltraPolyRS plasmids were transformed into E. coli DH10B. Cells were grown in
glycerol minimal medium with leucine or 2× YT medium, supplemented with
ampicillin (50 μg/mL), spectinomycin (25 μg/mL), and various ncAAs as a
concentration of 1 mM at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.6, at which point IPTG was
added to a final concentration of 1 mM. After 16 h at 30 °C, the cells were
harvested by centrifugation at 4,700 × g for 10 min and washed three times
with PBS. Cells were resuspended in PBS and transferred to a clear-bottom
96-well plate, and GFP-fluorescence was measured by using a plate reader
(485 nm excitation and 510 nm emission).

Xiao et al.

Determination of the MIC. The MICs of different antibiotics for various TEM-1
β-lactamase mutants were determined as described (48, 49). A single colony
of E. coli DH10B harboring plasmids pUltra-PolyRS and pBK (encoding the
TEM-1 β-lactamase variants) was used to inoculate 5 mL of LB medium
supplemented with spectinomycin (25 μg/mL) and kanamycin (25 μg/mL) at
37 °C. The overnight culture was then diluted to 1:400, and 4 μL of the
bacterial culture was placed on an LB agar plate supplemented with spectinomycin (25 μg/mL), kanamycin (25 μg/mL), 1 mM ncAA, and 1 mM IPTG.
After 48 h of incubation at 37 °C, the MIC was recorded as the lowest concentration of antibiotics on which no colonies were observed. The MICs were
calculated from triplicate experiments.
Expression and Purification of TEM β-Lactamases. The pUltra-PolyRS and
pET30b-T5-TEM1-216TAG plasmids were transformed into the E. coli DH10B
strain. Cells were grown in TB medium and supplemented with spectinomycin (25 μg/mL), kanamycin (25 μg/mL), and 1 mM ncAA at 37 °C to an
OD600 of 0.6, at which point IPTG was added to a final concentration of
0.5 mM. After 20 h of incubation at 27 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,700 × g for 10 min. To purify the protein, cell pellets were
resuspended in loading buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) and lysed using a microfluidizer at 20,000 psi chamber pressure. The resulting cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for
30 min, and the proteins were purified on Ni2+-NTA resin following the
manufacturer’s (Qiagen) instructions. The resulting protein was further
concentrated with an Amicon ultrafiltration device (membrane molecular
mass cutoff, 10,000 Da), reconstituted in 0.01 M Tris·HCl buffer (pH 7.5), and
loaded onto a MonoQ anion-exchange column. The protein was eluted
with a gradient of NaCl in 0.01 M Tris·HCl buffer (pH 7.5) at a flow rate of
2 mL/min. The protein fractions with right molecular mass determined by
Coomassie brilliant blue staining were collected and pooled.
Determination of Kinetic Properties of β-Lactamase Variants. TEM-1 β-lactamases activities against cephalexin was determined with a Hewlett-Packard
8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at
room temperature by monitoring changes in absorption upon β-lactam ring
opening, using the following extinction coefficient: cephalexin, Δe266 =
7,800 M−1·cm−1. The initial velocities were measured and data were fitted to
the Michaelis–Menten equation by using GraphPad Prism5 to determine kcat
and KM.
Crystallization of β-Lactamase Variants. Crystallization screening was performed with Mosquito Robot (TTP Labtech Ltd.) by using the vapor-diffusion
method in a sitting-drop manner at room temperature, and the initial crystals
were obtained from the Morpheus screen (Molecular Dimension Ltd.). Crystal
growth condition was optimized by using vapor diffusion in a hanging-drop
manner with a 1:1 ratio of 1 μL of reservoir solution and 1 μL of protein
solution at a concentration of 12 mg/mL in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl,
and 10% glycerol. Single crystals appeared after 24 h and grew to their
maximum size within a week. The best crystals grew in 0.1 M 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), pH 6.5, 15% PEG 20.000, and 15% PEG
550MME at 22 °C. The crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen before
they were mounted for data collection. All crystals grew in similar conditions, but streak seeding or macro seeding from the wild-type protein
crystals was essential to initiate the crystal growth.
Crystals were soaked with Cephalexin by transferring a single crystal to a
pre-equilibrated drop of reservoir (0.1 M MES, pH 6.5, 17% PEG20.000, and
17% PEG550MME) and 40 mM cephalexin solution (10 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 100 mM
NaCl, and 10% glycerol) at a 1:1 ratio. The crystals were transferred to a new
drop every 3 h and were incubated overnight in the fifth drop. Crystals were
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored the next day.
X-Ray Diffraction Data Collection and Structure Determination. The X-ray
diffraction data were collected either at an in-house X-ray source (Rigaku FR-E
SuperBright) with Rigaku RAXIS-HTC detector or at Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Lightsource using beamlines BL 11-1 and BL 7-1 with PILATUS 6M
PAD and ADSC QUANTUM 315R detector, respectively. The collected data
were indexed and integrated with imosflm or XDS and scaled by using Scala, a
part of the CCP4 suite (50–53). Initial phase information was obtained by
molecular replacement using PHASER with the previously solved structure of
TEM1 β-lactamase as a search model (PDB ID code 1BTL) (54). During the
initial round of the refinement, waters were added by using ArpWarp (55).
The structure was improved by iterative rounds of model building and refinement with the programs Coot and Refmac5 (56, 57). The crystals belonged
to space group P212121, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Crystallographic details and statistics are listed in Table S5.

BIOCHEMISTRY

(kcat/KM) of the enzyme. Thus, we demonstrate that an expanded
set of building blocks beyond the canonical 20 can lead to enhanced activity by unexpected mechanisms, which may be distinct from those possible through conventional mutagenesis
schemes. It is likely that ncAAs will also provide the opportunity
to enhance other properties of proteins—for example, electrophilic keto-containing amino acids may increase the stability of a
protein through the formation of covalent cross-links to lysine or
act as an electron sink in catalysis, and redox active amino acids
might facilitate electron transfer reactions. However, it remains
to be determined whether genetically encoded ncAAs can provide a unique evolutionary advantage that cannot be achieved by
either single or multiple canonical amino acid mutations at other
sites in a protein or the incorporation of nonproteinogenic cofactors. We expect that further advances in site-specific ncAA
incorporation technology in combination with other new mutagenesis techniques, such as TAG codon scanning, multiplex automated genomic engineering, and multiplex iterative plasmid
engineering, may provide the opportunity to address this question at a more global whole-organism level (43–46).
