Glutamine is an essential nutrient for cancer cell proliferation,
especially in the context of citric acid cycle anaplerosis. In this
manuscript we present results that collectively demonstrate that,
of the three major mammalian glutaminases identified to date, the
lesser studied splice variant of the gene gls, known as Glutaminase
C (GAC), is important for tumor metabolism. We show that,
although levels of both the kidney-type isoforms are elevated in
tumor vs. normal tissues, GAC is distinctly mitochondrial. GAC is
also most responsive to the activator inorganic phosphate, the
content of which is supposedly higher in mitochondria subject to
hypoxia. Analysis of X-ray crystal structures of GAC in different
bound states suggests a mechanism that introduces the tetramerization-induced lifting of a “gating loop” as essential for the phosphate-dependent activation process. Surprisingly, phosphate binds
inside the catalytic pocket rather than at the oligomerization interface. Phosphate also mediates substrate entry by competing with
glutamate. A greater tendency to oligomerize differentiates GAC
from its alternatively spliced isoform and the cycling of phosphate
in and out of the active site distinguishes it from the liver-type
isozyme, which is known to be less dependent on this ion.
glutamine metabolism ∣ Warburg effect

T

he highly proliferative phenotype places special demands
upon the metabolism of transformed cells. An upscaled glycolytic pathway, even in the presence of oxygen, is used by tumors
to supply a great deal of its energetic and biosynthetic demand
for cell division. Aerobic glycolysis, or the Warburg effect, as this
phenomenon is commonly known, is accepted today as a metabolic hallmark of cancer cells and has been exploited for diagnosis
(1, 2). In addition to glucose, tumors are also required to take up
great amounts of other extracellular nutrients, such as the amino
acid glutamine, and quickly and efficiently metabolize them for
shunting into the appropriate pathways (3, 4).
Glutamate production by mitochondrial glutaminase (GA),
the first enzyme in glutaminolysis, is a key process for body homeostasis, and a crucial carbon donor for amino acid and lipid synthesis in tumor cells, as reviewed by DeBerardinis, et al. (4). To
date, three mammalian GAs have been identified: the Liver-type
[LGA or GLS2 (5)], the Kidney-type [KGA (6)] and Glutaminase
C [GAC, (7)] a splice variant of KGA (both usually referred to
as GLS1). Overall, LGA and KGA present distinct tissue distributions and phosphate dependence for catalysis (8, 9). Recent
studies have also stressed the importance of glutaminolysis in
maintaining the malignant phenotype, providing indications that
glutaminases may be potential therapeutic targets in some cancer
cells (4, 10–13). Elevated GAC mRNA levels have been detected
in glyomas (14, 15), colorectal carcinomas and adenomas (16),
and breast tumor cell lines (7), when compared to normal cells.
Gao and coworkers showed that c-Myc induces elevated GAC
expression in both prostate cancer and B lymphoma cell lines as
well as in prostate cancer tissues vs. normal (17). Importantly,

Wang and colleagues have shown that modulation of the aberrant
GA activity via a small molecule, for which GAC was the identified target, inhibits oncogenic transformation (18). This collection of literature raises the suggestion that GAC is the key glutaminase isozyme in tumors. Thus, understanding the molecular
basis of GAC's activity and, most importantly, distinguishing it
from the KGA and LGA isozymes, will contribute to our understanding of tumor metabolism.
Here we demonstrate that both GAC and KGA protein levels
are increased in breast tumors compared to normal healthy tissues. Furthermore a similar pattern is repeated in cases of higher
compared to lower grades of invasive ductal breast carcinoma.
Cell fractionation of breast, prostate, and lung tumor cell lines,
followed by immunoblotting using isoform-specific antibodies
indicated that, under the experimental conditions used, GAC but
not KGA was found in the mitochondria. Subsequently we show
that GAC is the most efficient of the three isozymes in hydrolyzing glutamine in the presence of inorganic phosphate (Pi). Crystal
structures of GAC in different states (ligand-free and either
bound to phosphate or L-glutamate) established a “gating loop”
as the tetramer-driven mechanism of protein activation and show
how phosphate enhances catalysis. Our data collectively suggest
that GAC is key to the mitochondrial glutaminase metabolism
of cancer cells because of its exclusive localization and kinetic
properties.
Results
Protein Levels and Localization of the Kidney-Type Isoforms. KGA-

and GAC-specific antibodies (Fig. S1 A–C) were employed in
immunohystochemical analyses of two human breast cancer
tissue arrays. The results show that the expression levels of both
isoforms are increased in tumors compared to normal tissues and
positively correlate to the tumor grade (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1D). Moreover, the data show that in breast (SKBR3 and MDA-MB231),
prostate (PC3 and DU145) and lung (A549) tumor cell lines,
KGA is localized in the cytosol but not in the mitochondria

Enzyme Characterization. Intrigued by the above mentioned findings, we decided to study the catalytic properties of GAC in
comparison to the other two isozymes. Equal concentrations of
protein (5 nM) were tested for their ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of L-glutamine in the presence of phosphate (Pi, 0 to 50 mM
final concentration). We verified that the addition of phosphate
leads to an increase in the turnover rate of all glutaminases, but
at distinct levels. KGA kcat-app increases from 7.2 s−1 in the absence of Pi to 29.7 s−1 at 50 mM Pi. Within the same range of
phosphate, the kcat-app of GAC and LGA present a similar
marked increase, going from 7.8 s−1 and 6.9 s−1 to 37.0 s−1 and
43.1 s−1 , respectively. Simultaneously, the K m-app for KGA and
GAC decreased as Pi concentration increased, going from
15.6 mM and 18.4 mM (in the absence of Pi) to 8.5 and
2.1 mM (at 50 mM Pi), respectively. In sharp contrast the K m-app
of LGA increased four times over the same interval of Pi concentration starting at 15.2 mM and going up to 60.5 mM, at 50 mM
Pi. The parameters reported above, as well as those obtained at
intermediate Pi concentrations are shown in Fig. 2 A and B.
Validation of the coupled assay, original activity data with standard deviations, as well as kinetic curves are presented in
Tables S1 and S2, Fig. S2 A–D.
The overall individual behaviors become more evident when
we plot the catalytic efficiency (kcat-app ∕K m-app ) as a function of
the concentration of Pi (Fig. 2C). For LGA, the increase in
kcat-app coupled to that of K m-app , resulted in little to no change
in its efficiency over the range of Pi concentration studied
(0.5 mM−1 :s−1 in the absence of Pi and 0.7 mM−1 :s−1 at
50 mM Pi), in agreement with previous knowledge of its low
affinity for glutamine and low phosphate dependence (8). In the

absence or at low phosphate levels, KGA is as effective as LGA,
but presents an eightfold gain in efficiency at 50 mM Pi. Strikingly, GAC becomes by far the most effective isozyme in
converting glutamine to glutamate as the concentration of Pi
is increased (Fig. 2C), since an improvement of over 40 times
in its catalytic efficiency is observed within the range from 0 mM
to 50 mM Pi (kcat-app ∕K m-app of 0.4 mM−1 :s−1 and 17.6 mM−1 :s−1 ,
respectively).
Structure of Ligand-Free GAC. To provide further insight into its
functional details, we solved the GAC structure in three different
states. A ligand-free form was solved by molecular replacement
using the active site portion of the human glutaminase (PDB
entry 3czd) as search model, and refined to 2.42 Å resolution
(Rfactor of 19.5% and Rfree of 25.0%) (Table S3). The assymetric
unit is composed by four GAC molecules, with the monomers
spanning the residues Lys144 to Arg550 (NCBI reference sequence NP_001106854.1). The crystallized construct consisted of
residues Met128 to Ser603, thus missing 15 residues at the N terminus and 53 at the C terminus (Fig. 3A). Loop regions between
residues Ala153 and Gly155, Asp253 and Gln257, Leu191 and
Val198, Gly320 and Ile326 were consistently poorly ordered across
the monomers and therefore not modeled into the electron density. Structural details are presented using chain A as reference.
No function has been described so far for the N-terminal region
of mammalian glutaminases, which in mouse GAC comprises
residues Pro76 to Val225. In our crystal structure, we have found
that residues Leu144 to Asn221 fold into a unicornate four-helix
bundle. Among the helices, the amphipathic LXXLL motif (commonly termed the NR box, short for Nuclear Receptor box, where
X is any amino acid) can be recognized spanning residues Leu144
to Leu148. NR boxes participate in protein-protein interactions
associated with different aspects of transcriptional regulation of
nuclear receptor coregulators (21). The hypothesis that glutaminases may participate in transcription regulation has been raised
previously (22), however there is still a lack of experimental
evidence. A more detailed analysis of this region can be found in
Fig. S3 A–D.
Fig. 2. GAC has the highest activity in the presence
of phosphate. (A) Kinetic analysis of the three isozymes shows that the apparent affinity for glutamine of KGA and GAC increases with higher
concentrations of Pi, as opposed to what is observed
for LGA, as suggested by their K m-app values. (B) Catalytic rates are increased, though at lower levels for
KGA, as more phosphate is added to the reaction.
(C) GAC becomes the most efficient isozyme already
at concentrations of Pi around 10 mM.

(Fig. 1B), as confirmed by immunofluorescence of SKBR3 cells
(Fig. 1C). In contrast, GAC is the only isoform present in the
mitochondria (Fig. 1B). LGA mRNA levels were very low in the
breast tumor cell lines in comparison with HMEC (Fig. S1E), as
has been reported for the prostate cancer cell line PC3 and
the lymphoma cell line B P493 (17). This observation might be
related to p53 inactivation (19, 20).

GAC. (A) Orthogonal views of the
tetramer in cartoon representation. Circles indicate, in chain A,
the two distinct domains comprising the full structure: amino-terminal and glutaminase. Though
present in the crystallized construct, the C terminus is heterogeneous in conformation and could
not be successfully modeled.
Stereographic views of the cationic
active site of GAC, represented by
electrostatic surface mapping
(8 kb Tec − 11 ) for the three crystal forms, show the presence of
chloride (B), phosphate (C) and Lglutamate (D). 2F o -F c Fourier electron density maps of the ligands
are contoured at 1σ.

The glutaminase domain in GAC is comprised of residues Lys249
to Tyr535, and belongs to the beta-lactamase/transpeptidaselike superfamily, as previously described (*, 23). The active site is
located between two tightly associated subdomains: an α/β/α sandwich subdomain, including a β-sheet composed of 5 β-strands and
a purely α-helical subdomain, arranged into a bifurcated fold.
According to the 3V (Voss Volume Voxelator) server (24), the catalytic pocket has a volume of 580 Å3 . Electrostatic potential surface
mapping shows a very positively charged active site (Fig. 3B), receiving contributions from Lys294 and Lys486 as well as the N-terminal
dipole moment of helices spanning residues Ser291 to Leu305
and Asn340 to Ile350. One chloride ion was found inside the active
site of each monomer, interacting with the catalytic residue Ser291,
as well as Tyr471 and Val489. This very favorable coordination [gain
in free energy of −10.6 kcal∕mol upon complex formation, according to the PISA (Protein Interfaces, Surfaces and Assemblies) server
(25)] explains previous biochemical reports that glutaminase activity
is actually impaired under high concentrations of sodium chloride
(9), which adds up to 700 mM in the crystallization condition. The
majority of the C-terminal portion of GAC is conformationally
heterogeneous and therefore could not be modeled. No potential
function has been suggested to date for the GAC carboxy-terminal
region.
The assembly of the four monomers in the asymmetric unit
correlates well in size and shape with the oligomer obtained in
solution after size-exclusion purification, either in the absence
or presence of 40 mM phosphate, as confirmed by small angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS) (Fig. S4A). In our structure, chains A
and C form one of the dimers and chains B and D the complementary one. The contacts that define the dimers and the tetramers are all within the glutaminase domain. According to the
default criteria of the PISA server, 45 residues from each monomer share the dimer interface, making 20 hydrogen bonds (nine
salt bridges), resulting in a gain in solvation energy of −11.3 kcal∕
mol and about 1;600 Å2 of occluded area. The tetramer is then
formed by the pairing of chain A with chain D and chain B with
chain C. The dimers are twisted by about 25° with respect to each
other, along the shortest axis of the oligomer (Fig. S4B). The interfaces result from the stacking of equivalent α-helices extending
from Asp391 to Lys401 and are mediated mostly by hydrophobic
interactions between Phe394, Ala395, Tyr398, and Tyr399. Each
pairing buries on average 460 Å2 of area and also favors the
formation of four hydrogen bonds (three salt bridges), with an
average gain in solvation energy of −7.5 kcal∕mol. Oppositely
charged residues (Asp391 and Lys401) sit on opposing ends of the

helix, therefore providing proper orientation of the complementary interfaces.
Structures of Phosphate- and L-Glutamate-Bound GAC. To gain insight
into the molecular mechanism that drives the activation of GAC,
we have also determined its crystal structure bound to Pi at 2.85 Å
resolution (Rfactor and Rfree of 22.7% and 26.9%, respectively—
Table S3). This crystal is isomorphous with the ligand-free form,
containing the same tetramer in the asymmetric unit (backbone
rmsd of 0.43 Å). Our current knowledge regarding the activation
mechanism of GA is related to the correlation between the presence of phosphate and the protein’s quaternary structure, in
which dimers associate into tetramers, thus establishing the catalysis-competent state of the enzyme (26, 27). This model led us
to expect phosphate ions interacting in the surroundings of the
tetramerization interface. Surprisingly only one ion was found
per monomer, and this was buried inside the highly positive active
site where it makes polar contacts with Ser291, Asn340 and
Tyr471, and two water molecules (Fig. 3C). On average, the presence of Pi inside the active site results in a gain in free energy of
−5.4 kcal∕mol. Furthermore, as a consequence of the binding of
Pi to Ser291 and Tyr471, the chloride ion found in the previous
structure is displaced from the active site.
We subsequently grew crystals of GAC previously incubated
with 10 mM sodium L-glutamate. The final model was refined
to 2.80 Å resolution (Rfactor and Rfree of 20.6% and 24.0%, respectively). The overall structure is highly conserved, with a core rmsd
of 0.31 Å and 0.40 Å, when superposed to the ligand-free and the
phosphate-bound models, respectively. One molecule of L-glutamate is found bound to the active site of each monomer (Fig. 3D).
The amino group in the main chain branch of the ligand is hydrogen-bonded to Glu386, Asn340, Tyr419, and Asn393. On its side
chain branch, the carboxylic acid moiety makes polar interactions
with Ser291, Tyr471 and the main chain nitrogen of Val489.
Structure-Based Biochemistry. To determine key events for GAC
activation, we generated a point mutant by replacing Phe394 from
the tetramer interface by a serine (Fig. 4A), termed GAC.F394S.
This mutation was enough to break the tetramer into dimers, even
in the presence of high phosphate concentrations (Fig. S5A).
Differently from the wild-type GAC, the addition of phosphate
to GAC.F394S had little effect on its K m-app (14.0 mM and
12.3 mM for 0 mM and 50 mM Pi, respectively), and changed little
its already low catalytic efficiency (kcat-app ∕K m-app of 0.4 mM−1 :s−1
and 1.0 mM−1 :s−1 ) when in the absence and presence of 50 mM Pi,
respectively (Fig. 4B, Fig. S2, Table S1), reinforcing the importance
of tetramerization for protein activation.
As already mentioned, GAC eluted as a tetramer after sizeexclusion purification (Fig. S4A). By making serial dilutions of
pure protein samples and running them in a gel-filtration column,
Cassago et al.

six-residue-long loop found across the three structures (Leu321
to Leu326, Fig. 4D). This observation, combined with its close
proximity to the active site region, led us to hypothesize about
a possible role in regulating accessibility to the active site, explaining why tetramerization decreases the K m of the enzyme.
The underlying rationale is that, in the GAC dimer, the open
form of this loop (hereon referred to as the gating loop), is transient and a closed form must be present in large excess, leading to
a low affinity and a limited hydrolytic rate for glutamine. Accompanying tetramer assembly, conformational changes involving
Phe327 are triggered, lifting the gating loop and exposing the active site. If this assumption is correct, then artificially disturbing
the loop would result in a more substrate accessible glutaminase.
Indeed, the point mutant Phe327Ser (GAC.F327S) showed a
K m as low as 8.2 mM, even in the absence of phosphate and
at only 5 nM protein concentration (Fig. 4C). The K m then
dropped to 0.8 mM when 50 mM of K 2 HPO4 was added to the
assay, thus showing the importance of the gating loop in regulating active site accessibility.
Finally, serial dilution experiments with wild-type GAC,
followed by gel-filtration in the presence of 20 mM K 2 HPO4 ,
showed a shift in the equilibrium of the species towards tetramers
and higher oligomers, when compared to the protein in the absence of Pi (Fig. 4C), as already reported (29, 30). Apart from its
effect in enzyme cycling, another direct effect of the addition of
Pi is the stabilization of tetramers, likely by inducing the opening
of the gating loop. Indeed, chloride, which competes with Pi for
binding to the catalytic Ser291, at high concentration (500 mM
NaCl) can dislodge phosphate from its site and shift the protein
equilibrium to lower-order oligomers (Fig. S5B).
GAC and KGA: Same Active Site, Different Catalytic Capabilities. The
splicing event that originates GAC occurs at the C-terminalencoding region of the gls gene. Therefore, the N-terminal and
glutaminase domains of both KGA and GAC are identical, indicating that the carboxy-terminal region must be crucial for the
observed differences in enzymatic behavior (Fig. 2). The great
majority of the C-terminal portion of GAC is conformationally heterogeneous in our crystal structures and therefore could not be

we were able to show that tetramerization is a concentrationdependent event. In Fig. 4C (left box), we observe successive
shifts in the population equilibrium, starting at the Stokes radius
expected for the tetramer and moving towards smaller species,
closer to the radius of the dimer, as the solution is diluted [Stokes
radii calculated by Hydropro (28), based on the crystal structure].
Due to experimental sensitivity limitations, the lowest protein
concentration measured was 50 nM. We then performed the glutaminase assay in the absence of Pi, at GAC concentrations
similarly to those used in the serial dilution experiment (ranging
from 25 nM to 200 nM). Interestingly, the results (Fig. 4C, right
box, Fig. S2E) readily show a much lower K m at 25 nM GAC
(4.3 mM), when compared to 5 nM GAC (K m of 18.4 mM,
Table S1). As GAC concentration was increased further up to
200 nM, the K m dropped to 0.9 mM which correlates well with
the presence of the heavier species (Fig. 4C, left box). Nonetheless,
the turnover rates remained low at all protein concentrations
tested, resulting in little change in enzyme efficiency (kcat ∕K m
going from 0.5 mM−1 :s−1 to 1.1 mM−1 :s−1 at 25 nM and
200 nM GAC, respectively), confirming that increases in the
turnover rates of GAC depend specifically on Pi and are not solely
determined by tetramerization (Fig. 2). This observation can
be explained by the crystal structures presented here, which show
that phosphate and glutamate compete for the same residues
of the cationic active site. Fig. 3 C and D show that both anions
contact Ser291, the nucleophilic agent of catalysis, and Pi is therefore likely to promote product release during the catalytic cycle
and to reduce product accumulation-induced inhibition of GLS1
(29, 30). We then conclude that while protein tetramerization is
important for increasing substrate affinity, phosphate guarantees
the cycling of the enzyme.
We next focused our attention on the dimer-dimer intermolecular contacts looking for clues for the molecular basis of the
oligomerization-driven GAC activation. Particularly noteworthy
is the side chain of Phe327, which in all monomers, is part of
a hydrophobic cluster located at the tetramer interface, formed
by the complementary stacking of Phe327 itself, Ala395, Ile396,
Tyr399, in chain A, with its equivalent residues in chain D. Phe327
is the first well structured residue after a consistently disordered

modeled. Secondary structure prediction using internet tools suggests this region to contain a short α-helix (from Tyr563 to Leu572)
and an extended strand spanning residues Thr590 to Glu597,
interspersed within random coil. KGA on the other hand, is predicted to have three ankyrin repeats within its longer C-terminal
region (Fig. S6).
KGA serial dilution, both in the presence and absence of phosphate (Fig. 5), shows a much slower drift in the equilibrium
toward larger species when compared to GAC (Fig. 4C), which
is reflected in the kinetic parameters obtained by increasing the
KGA concentration (original curves in Fig. S2E). In going from
5 nM to 200 nM KGA, its K m is reduced only by about 2.5 times,
as opposed to 14 times in the case of GAC`s (Fig. 4C). Deletion
of the stretch between residues Arg539 to Ser 603 of GAC
(GAC.DelC), which represents a common denominator between
KGA and GAC, especially increased the K m-app of the protein,
even in the presence of phosphate, to levels of the dimer mutant
(Fig. 4B), suggesting that the unique C terminus of GAC is
important for facilitating protein oligomerization, though the
specifics are still not clear.

GAC Was Found in the Mitochondria and KGA in the Cytoplasm: Implications for Cancer Metabolism. The central role played by gluta-

mine-based intermediary metabolism in malignant cells has been
recently highlighted with the observation that previously known
oncogenes and signaling pathways tightly regulate glutaminase
expression and activity levels. Gao and coworkers have shown that
c-Myc induces elevated GA expression in prostate cancer and B
lymphoma cell lines (17). Curiously, the GLS1 isoform induced
by Myc in mitochondria of P493-6 B cells was GAC. Wang and
coworkers demonstrated that transformed fibroblasts and breast
cancer cells exhibit elevated GA activity that is dependent on
Rho GTPases and NF-κB activity (18). The authors also present
a small molecule that selectively abrogates the growth of transformed cells, by targeting GAC, without impairing the growth of
normal cells. Here, working with isoform-specific antibodies, we
showed that both KGA and GAC protein levels are enhanced
in breast tumor tissues, but only GAC was located in the mitochondria of tumor cell lines.
Named after the discovery of its enzymatic activity (31), mammalian glutaminases turned out to be more complex proteins,
with a distinctive combination of additional motifs and functional
domains. A consensus sequence of transit peptides that directs
the enzyme to the mitochondria can be identified in the first 16
amino acids of GAC and KGA. Therefore, the result presented
here demonstrating the localization of KGA in the cytoplasm of
the cell lines studied as a likely full-length precursor form of
72–74 kDa, is particularly striking. A possible explanation however, might come from the C-terminal portions, which share only
12% sequence identity. KGA is predicted to contain three ankyrin repeats which exclusively function to mediate protein-protein

Fig. 5. Concentration-dependent oligomerization and activation profile of
KGA. This isoform responds much more slowly than GAC to increases in
protein concentration regarding shifts in the equilibrium towards species
of higher Stokes radius. Furthermore, the addition of phosphate has no
effects on the overall profile (left box). The slowed response is also reflected
in less significant changes in the enzyme’s K m (right box), when compared to
GAC (Fig. 4C).

interactions and have been found in proteins of diverse function
such as cell-cycle regulators, transcriptional initiators, cytoskeletal
proteins, ion transporters, and signal transducers (32). Furthermore, aside from the N-terminal NR box motif in all three glutaminase isozymes, as the structure of GAC presented here confirms,
the last five amino acids in the KGA sequence (LDGLL) may also
serve as a second NR box. Hence, it would come as no surprise if
the involvement of KGA in processes taking place outside the mitochondrial boundaries is soon demonstrated. Furthermore, it has
already been shown that LGA, which also may contain one NRbox
and a C-terminal ankyrin repeat, can localize in the nuclei of neuronal cells (22). Apart from the strong influence on the catalytic
activity of GAC, no function can be predicted for its 53 amino acid
long C terminus, based on the current knowledge on protein motifs
and domains. In this context, GAC might be more relevant for the
anaplerosis of the TCA cycle.
GLS1 Mechanism of Activation. Early biochemical studies of the kidney-type isozyme reported that mitochondrial glutaminases are
mostly found as inactive dimers in the organelle and that the presence of phosphate correlates with changes leading to tetramerization and enzyme activation (26, 27). We have described here crystal
structures of GAC tetramers in different bound states, and shown
that the same tetramer is found in solution in the presence or absence of phosphate. Tetramerization, a concentration-dependent
event enhanced by phosphate, is the main cause of increasing protein affinity for the substrate due to the opening of a so-called gating
loop. Binding of the adjacent Phe327 to the tetramer interface stabilizes the open form of the loop permitting the diffusion of substrate
into the active site, thus providing a structural correlation between
the cooperative oligomer activation and gating access to the active
site. Concomitantly, the presence of phosphate plays the central role
in increasing the turnover rates of the enzyme. Enzyme inhibition by
glutamate has been reported for the kidney isoform of GLS1 (29).
Furthermore, Sayre and Roberts showed in 1958 that glutamate inhibition of glutaminases was found to be competitive with phosphate
(33). In this sense, we show with our crystal structures that Pi competes with glutamate for the cationic active site, accelerating product
exchange and at the same time avoiding enzyme inhibition as
product accumulates. While the described mechanism is shared between KGA and GAC isoforms, as they have the same glutaminase
domain, it is possible that direct interactions between the GAC Cterminal region and the active site (which were not captured in our
crystal structures) might occur to enhance catalysis.
Inorganic Phosphate Levels as a Sensor for Glutamine-Based Anaplerosis. GAC was first identified and found overexpressed in

the human breast carcinoma cell line TSE (7). Subsequent work
reported elevated GAC mRNA levels in tumors when compared
to normal cell lines (15, 16). These observations, taken together
with the work of Gao, et al. (17) and Wang, et al. (18), led us to
ask whether this isoform might have intrinsic catalytic properties
which allow it to perform better within the cancer microenvironment. Mammalian GA activity has been described as sensitive to
inorganic phosphate (Pi), with KGA being activated by it and
LGA being less sensitive (8, 9). To evaluate side-by-side the three
reported glutaminases, we produced recombinant proteins and
performed the activity assays at increasing amounts of Pi, up
to 50 mM. We have confirmed that KGA and LGA’s individual
responses to Pi are quite distinct one from another, but, surprisingly, GAC presented the highest efficiency (kcat-app ∕K m-app )
towards L-glutamine at higher concentrations of Pi. To our
knowledge there is no data available in the literature concerning
the mitochondrial levels of inorganic phosphate in tumor cells. It
has been shown, however, that in guinea pig hearts the cellular
concentration of Pi changes from 1.7, to 7.1 and 13.9 mM, in
going from normal to mildly hypoxic to severely hypoxic conditions, respectively (34). Taking into consideration the changes
Cassago et al.

in mitochondrial homeostasis due to hypoxia for instance, the reduction of F1 Fo ATPase activity (35), which uses Pi to produce
ATP, may lead to local levels of inorganic phosphate reaching
even higher concentrations. Surviving hypoxic conditions is one
of the main driving forces in the selection that leads to cancer
progression. In this sense, we hypothesize that the accumulation
of inorganic phosphate in the mitochondria is the trigger for increased GAC-based glutaminase activity. Under these circumstances, GAC may provide for the increased metabolic and
biosynthetic needs, thus conferring selective advantage to malignant cells. Therefore, drug-based therapies specifically targeting
the mitochondrial metabolism of glutamine seem more likely to
succeed if developed to be GAC specific.

Curthoys (9). GAC (Met128-Ser603) and LGA (Leu72-Val602)
were amplified from a mouse fetal brain tissue cDNA library
and cloned into the pET28a plasmid (Novagen). Standard heterologous protein expression and liquid chromatography techniques were used (see SI Text for details).
Crystallization and X-Ray Crystallography. Crystallization of the
GAC construct is described in detail in the SI Text. X-ray diffraction datasets were obtained at beamlines X12-C at NSLS (ligandfree crystals), F-1 at CHESS (phosphate-bound crystals) and
W02B-MX2 at LNLS (L-glutamate-bound crystals). Details of
data processing, phasing and model refinement can be found
in SI Text.
