Fragment-based design was used to guide derivatization of a
lead series of β-lactamase inhibitors that had heretofore resisted
optimization for in vivo activity. X-ray structures of fragments
overlaid with the lead suggested new, unanticipated functionality
and points of attachment. Synthesis of three derivatives improved
affinity over 20-fold and improved efficacy in cell culture. Crystal
structures were consistent with the fragment-based design, enabling further optimization to a K i of 50 pM, a 500-fold improvement that required the synthesis of only six derivatives. One of
these, compound 5, was tested in mice. Whereas cefotaxime
alone failed to cure mice infected with β-lactamase-expressing
Escherichia coli, 65% were cleared of infection when treated with
a cefotaxime:5 combination. Fragment complexes offer a path
around design hurdles, even for advanced molecules; the series
described here may provide leads to overcome β-lactamase-based
resistance, a key clinical challenge.

ead optimization in chemical biology and drug discovery is a
multifactorial problem and frequently stalls on the way to
tool molecules or clinical candidates. Confronted with an otherwise attractive compound series for which affinity or efficacy has
leveled off, for instance, one seeks an efficient derivatization
strategy in the face of many possible chemotypes and points of
derivatization. Multiple paths may be considered, from combinatorial derivatization among accessible side chains, to structurebased placement of specific groups. Neither of these strategies
can fully promise to overcome the challenge of knowing exactly
where and how to derivatize a lead.
We faced such a challenge with a series of boronic acid β-lactamase inhibitors. β-lactamases are the most common cause of
resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins; they threaten what remains the most widely used class
of antibiotics and have attracted much recent attention (1–5).
Third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins were partly introduced to overcome these enzymes, as were inhibitors like clavulanic acid, but resistance arose rapidly to these agents, which are
all themselves β-lactams and thus potential substrates of β-lactamases. Boronic acids, as non-lactam transition-state analogs, are
impervious to such mutants and are often transparent to other
β-lactam resistance mechanisms, such as β-lactamase upregulation. Using β-lactam functional groups on a boronic acid scaffold,
we rapidly optimized an initial class of boronic acids to midnanomolar affinity (6, 7), and with further derivatization to 1 nM
affinity against the class C β-lactamase AmpC (8). Notwithstanding their high affinity, these compounds had relatively modest
activity in bacterial cell culture. Though they certainly reduced
minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of third-generation
cephalosporins, they were unable to break through the empirical
resistance threshold—typically 2 μg∕mL—for most pathogens
(6–9). Subsequent efforts failed to further improve affinity (9).

Also, these molecules used functionality well explored among
β-lactams themselves to achieve their affinity—utilizing, for instance, the R1 side chains of cephalothin and ceftazidime, and the
C3(4)’ carboxylate of penicillins and cephalosporins—and so
they were subject to pre-evolved resistant mutant enzymes, such
as the inhibitor-resistant TEM30 (10).
To escape this cul-de-sac, we thought to replace the boronic
acid R1 carboxamide, which mimics the analogous group ubiquitous among β-lactam drugs, with a sulfonamide, as this would
not only change the electronic character of a key interaction
but also the geometry of the inhibitor (11). This switch scrambled
the structure-activity relationship previously observed with the carboxamides: Boronic acids with a carboxylate analogous to the C3
(4)’ group of penicillins and β-lactams lost 10- to 100-fold activity,
relative to the carboxamide series; conversely, small derivatives on
the R1 side, such as compounds 1 and 2 (Table 1), achieved K i
values as low as 70 and 25 nM, 8- to 20-fold better than observed
for analogous carboxamides. Unfortunately, further derivatization
failed to improve affinity; indeed, even the addition of a carboxylate to 1, leading to 2, improved activity only threefold, whereas
a similar derivative in an earlier series had improved affinity by
over 20-fold (12). We were stuck again.
Fragment-based discovery has anchored early lead discovery
for targets that have resisted traditional methods. Fragments
can optimally explore receptor pockets (13–18) and better cover
chemical space (19–22), and we wondered if they could guide
a late-stage optimization that had thus far floundered. In a previous fragment-based docking screen against AmpC (22) and in
a defragmentation study of a known AmpC inhibitor (23), crystal
structures of three anionic fragments were determined: a
thiophene carboxylic acid (F1), a benzoic acid (F2), and an aryl
tetrazole (F3), all of which bind in the same distal region of the
active site where the aryl carboxylate of compound 2 was placed
(Fig. 1 A, B, and D). The poses adopted by these fragments overlapped one another, and though in roughly the same spot as the
carboxylate of compound 2, they differed in their angle of attack
from the larger inhibitor (Fig. 1B). Consequently, in their crystallographic complexes with AmpC they hydrogen-bonded with the
backbone amides of Ser212 and Gly320, rather than with Ser212
alone as did the 2 carboxylate. Reasoning that the fragments

bound in geometries unperturbed by the restraints of the larger
molecule, we thought that boronic acids capturing this geometry
might have improved affinity and antibiotic efficacy. Here we
describe an optimization campaign guided by these fragments,
and follow these new derivatives into ever more biologically relevant investigations. A strategy for a fragment-based later-stage
lead optimization is considered.

Results
Fragment-Guided Design. Superposition of the X-ray structure complex of the 25 nM compound 2 with the X-ray complexes of fragments F1 and F2 suggested an initial optimization path (Fig. 1 A
and B). All three molecules contain an aryl carboxylate and all
occupy the same overall site in AmpC, but they adopt different
orientations (Fig. 1B). The two fragments orient their carboxylates
to hydrogen-bond with the backbone amides of Ser212 and
Gly320, while the carboxylate of the larger lead compound 2 hydrogen-bonds only with Ser212, leaving its second oxygen solvent
exposed; the aromatic ring plane also differs. We therefore modeled analogs of 2 that could position a carboxylate or a tetrazole
to superpose with the same groups in the fragments. Evaluation
of several candidates suggested that a boronic acid sulfonamide
bearing a benzyl side chain with a meta-carboxylate would do so
(i.e., by shifting the existing carboxylate in the lead 2 by one ring
position, Fig. 1C), whereas models derived from fragment F3 bearing a tetrazole (Fig. 1D) favored a para-phenyl derivative (i.e., by
replacing the carboxylate in the lead 2 by a tetrazole, Fig. 1E). The
pyrazolone ring in fragment F3 suggested that a pyridine would
also be favorable, potentially interacting either with the Gly320
backbone or a protonated tetrazole (i.e., a more involved perturbation, adding a tetrazole and a ring nitrogen, Fig. 1F).
Activity and Structures of the First Derivatives. K i values of the new

boronic acids 3, 4, and 5 were determined from IC50 curves, and
competition with the AmpC substrate CENTA was confirmed by
full Lineweaver-Burk analysis, as described (SI Appendix) (24).
All were competitive inhibitors with K i values ranging from 0.8
to 1.3 nM, an improvement of 20-to 30-fold relative to the lead 2
(Table 1). Whereas 2 had no measurable time dependence to its
activity, all three of the new inhibitors exhibited an incubation
effect owing to slow off-rates, as suggested by enzyme incubation
and dilution experiments (SI Appendix, Fig. S3) (25).
To understand the affinity increase at atomic resolution, we
determined the X-ray structures of compounds 3, 4, and 5 in complex with AmpC β-lactamase, to between 1.43 and 1.80 Å resolution (SI Appendix, Table S1). Initial F o -F c electron density maps
Eidam et al.

allowed all three new inhibitors to be modeled unambiguously
(SI Appendix, Fig. S4). As expected, the Oγ of the catalytic Ser64
forms a dative covalent bond to the boron atoms of the inhibitors,
with the boronic acid adopting a tetrahedral geometry. One
boronic oxygen hydrogen-bonds with the AmpC oxyanion hole,
defined by backbone amides of Ser64 and Ala318, while the other
oxygen hydrogen-bonds with Tyr150 and the conserved water 402
(Wat402), as observed in earlier boronic acid structures (24, 26,
27). Similarly, the key hydrogen bond between a sulfonamide
oxygen and Asn152 is conserved (Fig. 2 A–F). In the AmpC/3
complex an additional hydrogen bond is formed between the
sulfonamide nitrogen and the backbone carbonyl of Ala318. The
new benzyl ring makes parallel π–π stacking interactions with
Tyr221 while the carboxylate hydrogen bonds with backbone
amides of Ser212 and Gly320, as intended by design (Fig. 2A).
Meanwhile, the conserved moieties of the tetrazole 4 interact
largely as observed in the AmpC/3 complex, and though the
sulfonamide has shifted, it makes the same crucial hydrogen bond
to Asn152 (Fig. 2B). Unlike the benzyl of 3, the phenyl ring of 4
makes edge-to-face π–π stacking interactions with Tyr221 at an
angle of 55°. The tetrazole ring is almost coplanar with the phenyl
ring (angle: 13°) and two nitrogen atoms of the tetrazole ring
hydrogen-bond with Ser212 and Gly320 backbone amides, also
foreseen by design. Compound 5 differs from 4 only in the replacement of a phenyl by a pyridine in 5, which superimposes closely
on the 4 structure; an ordered water (Wat863) is observed to
interact with the pyridine nitrogen (as might, too, a protonated
form of the tetrazole intramolecularly) (Fig. 2C). Overall, the
modeled structures may be superposed with the crystallographic
results with little deviation (Fig. 3).
Further Optimization. Encouraged by the high affinity of these
compounds, we sought derivatives with even further improved
affinity. Aware that the tetrazole derivatives might have better
cell penetrance than the carboxylates (28), owing to a higher pK a
value, we chose to derivatize 4. We sought compounds that might
improve steric complementarity with the enzyme without disrupting other interactions. Modeling suggested that chloro derivatives
ortho- and meta- to the tetrazole were easily accommodated by
the site, as was a trifluoromethyl group in the meta-position.
Compounds 6, 7, and 8 were thus synthesized and tested; all three
were competitive, slow off-rate inhibitors of AmpC. While the
3-chloro derivative 6 had a worse K i of 3 nM, the 2-chloro and
2-trifluoromethyl derivatives 7 and 8 showed 6-and 24-fold
improved affinities compared to 4 with K i values of 200 and
50 picomolar, respectively. X-ray crystal structures of AmpC

complexes with 6, 7, and 8, determined at 1.43, 1.44, and 1.49 Å,
respectively, confirm that the new substitutions point away from
Tyr221 and towards Ala318 as anticipated (Fig. 2 D–F). In 7 and
8, the derivatives correspond closely to the precursor 4, while in 6
the plane of the phenyl is rotated by 20° to avoid a clash between
the 3-chloro and backbone atoms of Gly320. In 7, the 2-chloro is
in van der Waals contact with the Cβ and backbone carbonyl
atoms of Ala318 (3.8 and 3.6 Å, respectively). Similarly, in 8 the
2-trifluoromethyl makes comparable interactions and also packs
with the backbone of Thr319 (3.2–3.7 Å). The fluorines appear
to also interact with the sulfonamide amide hydrogen (F-N distance: 2.8 Å), forming orthogonal multipolar interactions with
the sulfonamide oxygen (F-O distance: 2.8 Å). To our knowledge,
the 50 pM activity of 8 makes it the most potent reversible β-lac-

Selectivity. To assess the selectivity of the new molecules we
determined K i values against three common serine proteases—
Trypsin, Elastase, and α-Chymotrypsin—as well as that of a class
A β-lactamase, CTX-M-9 (SI Appendix, Table S2) (30–33). Affinity for AmpC was typically 10 5 -to 10 6 -fold better than for the
serine proteases (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Notwithstanding the
boronic acid warhead shared by these inhibitors, the compounds
show clear specificity for their target over protease off-targets.
Affinity was also substantially better for AmpC than CTX-M-9,
which, though speaking to specificity, may portend difficulties for
clinical relevance, as one would ideally prefer a compound active
against both class C and class A enzymes. Still, several of the
analogs retained substantial affinity for CTX-M-9, especially 3,
which was a 45 nM inhibitor of CTX-M-9.

tigated by the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the β-lactam/inhibitor combination necessary
to inhibit the growth of clinically isolated bacteria resistant to
third-generation cephalosporins via expression of class A or class
C β-lactamases (Table 2). Used by themselves, the antibiotics
cefotaxime and ceftazidime had high MIC values, often greater
than 64 μg∕mL, certainly much higher than the break point for
empirical resistance levels ≥2 μg∕mL (34). Conversely, in combination with the new inhibitors, the MIC values of these thirdgeneration cephalosporins improved substantially, typically by
64-fold or more. For 75% of the clinical isolates measured, MICs
dropped into the susceptible range (MICs ≤1 μg∕mL) with compounds 3 and 5, for 50% with compounds 7 and 8, and for 25% of
those treated with the cephalosporins and 4 or 6 (SI Appendix,
Table S3). For many clinical isolates, MIC values for ceftazidime
and cefotaxime combined with 5 and 7 dropped to 0.5 μg∕mL
and below (SI Appendix, Fig. S6), which represents an 8-to 16-fold
improvement of MIC values compared to previously tested boronic acids (6, 8, 11).
Intriguingly, substantial decreases in MIC values were observed for a strain producing the plasmid-mediated class A β-lactamase CTX-M-14 (8-to 64-fold), especially for compounds 3
and 7, which had the broadest spectrums of activity. This offers
preliminary evidence that the sulfonamide boronic acids may inhibit both class C and class A β-lactamases, consistent with their
in vitro activity against this class of enzymes.
Efficacy in a Mouse Model of Infection. We had not observed such
substantial reversal of bacterial resistance to β-lactams, across
such a broad spectrum of clinical isolates, for previous series of
boronic acid inhibitors of β-lactamase; indeed, this lack of effi-

cacy had motivated this study. These new cell-culture MIC values
inspired us to investigate the efficacy of one of these compounds
in a mouse model of bacteremia and sepsis. Oncins France 1 mice
were infected with a hospital-derived strain of Escherichia coli
that overproduces AmpC and is highly resistant to cefotaxime
(MIC: 32 μg∕mL). Mice were treated with cefotaxime alone,
cefotaxime combined with compound 5, with sterile isotonic
saline, and with imipenem as a reference treatment of systemic
infections by cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae (Fig. 4);
20 mice were used in each clade. The animals became severely
sick 5 h after infection and all untreated animals (sterile isotonic
saline) died within 12–24 h. With a clinical dose of 50 mg∕kg,
imipenem was almost fully active (90% survival at 120 h postinfection). Only 15% of mice treated with cefotaxime alone
survived by at 120 h post infection. Cefotaxime:5 treatment,
conversely, rescued 65% of animals at the 120-h postinfection
timepoint, and those mice that did die did so later than with
cefotaxime alone. Statistical analysis confirms a significant
increase in the percent survival for the combination of 5 with
cefotaxime (p ≤ 0.0005 versus cefotaxime alone). No significant
difference was observed with imipenem treatment (p ≥ 0.1148
for the comparison cefotaxime:5 versus imipenem). Consistent
with the expectation that the cefotaxime:5 treatment has a direct
effect on bacteria, the colony forming unit (CFU) counts of

alone and to untreated controls (SI Appendix, Fig. S7 and
Table S4).
Discussion
The use of fragments in hit-to-lead development has become
popular in drug discovery, especially for difficult drug targets.
Fragments benefit from binding to pockets and surfaces unperturbed by restraints found in larger molecules, and often do so
with high ligand efficiency. By merging, linking, or growing fragments, high-affinity leads may be obtained. A second advantage
of fragments is that they cover much more chemical space than
lead-like molecules (13–15, 19–21).
Here we used both virtues to optimize a series already exhibiting decent affinity but insufficient biological activity. First, we
exploited the geometric information contained in aryl-carboxylate fragments. The lead compound 2 had a K i of 25 nM against
AmpC β-lactamase and lowered MIC values eightfold on average. Modeling suggested that 3 could pick up the interactions
observed in fragments F1 and F2. In fact, only a different orientation for the benzoic acid substructure contained in the lead 2
seemed necessary, which could be obtained by moving the carboxylate from para- to meta-. This improved affinity of compound 3
almost 20-fold over 2, while the affinity 3 is 54-fold better than 1
(ΔΔG ¼ 1.9 kcal∕mol), which can be attributed to the carboxylate
in a preferred environment. Indeed, the placement of the distal
carboxylate of 3 between Ser212 and Gly320 superposes well with
that observed in F2 (Fig. 3A), recapitulating the designed structure
with a RMSD of 0.3 Å (Fig. 3B). The improved affinity also
improved antimicrobial activity: MIC values dropped 64-fold on
average and the median MIC for 3 was 1 μg∕mL against 12 highly
resistant strains (SI Appendix, Table S3), below the empirical
break point for hospital infections. Fortuitously, compound 3 also
inhibits class A β-lactamases efficiently, with a K i of 45 nM against
CTX-M-9. Correspondingly, it lowers MIC values for bacteria
expressing this enzyme, in combination with ceftazidime and cefotaxime, by 8-and 64-fold respectively, making it the compound with
best broad-spectrum activity within this series.
In the tetrazole series, we were guided by the geometric information contained in fragment F3. The tetrazoles of the designed
molecules 4 and 5 superpose well with that of F3, and the initial
models agree well with the subsequent crystal structures, with
RMSD values of 0.9 Å and 0.7 Å, respectively (Fig. 3 C–F). Comparison with the K i of molecule 9 (K i 210 nM) suggests that the
tetrazole added about 3 kcal∕mol of affinity, improving the K i
170-fold in compound 4 and 250-fold in the pyridine derivative
5. Tetrazoles are common bioisosteres of carboxylates and often
have better bioavailability (28, 35). Although they are not unprecedented in β-lactam antibiotics (e.g., cefazolin), boronic acid
inhibitors of β-lactamases have not yet exploited this chemotype
in this region of the active site. While previous generations of
boronic acids focused on mimicking β-lactam substrates, these
fragment-derived boronic acids exhibit greater novelty and may
be more robust against pre-evolved mutant enzymes that overcome boronic acids more closely resembling β-lactams (10).
Whereas fragments have been used previously for new chemotype discovery (13–22) and merging, their use in late stage optimization has remained largely unexplored. Of course nothing
prevented this, and indeed such an idea is implicit in the fragment
approach and anticipated by computational design methods like
LUDI, HOOK, GrowMol, and MCSS (36–39). Still, late-stage
optimization with fragments seems underdeveloped; it can reveal
derivatization strategies, both in geometry and in chemotype,
that may otherwise remain unknown without an industrial-scale
hit-to-lead campaign.
Certain caveats deserve attention. This approach to optimizing
leads with fragments is restricted to targets where proximal binding sites can be detected and for which fragment orientations
17452 ∣

can be accurately determined. It also requires a decomposable
lead series where substantial inhibition remains with only a core
chemotype, which is not always the case (23, 40). Whereas these
compounds did turn out to be additive in affinity gained—compared to the naked sulfonamide they added over 2-logs, while the
K i values of the fragments were between 3 and 40 mM—this
too will not always hold. Indeed, in another series of analogs that
also tried to exploit the fragment placement, no improvement in
affinity was achieved. There are also cautions to the mouse experiments—in the cephalosporin/inhibitor combination clade,
we preserved the cefotaxime/inhibitor ratio of 1∶4 of the MIC
experiments. This resulted in a final concentration of 200 mg∕kg
for inhibitor 5, which is very high. Future studies may focus on
the analysis and improvement of pharmacokinetic properties
and proper evaluation of toxicity and activity against a larger
panel of bacteria. Fortunately, because the molecules remain
small (molecular weights range from 270 to 350 Da), there is
room for further optimization.
These caveats should not obscure the central observation of
this study—two series of fragments, bound in a particular pocket
revealed an opportunity to derivatize a relatively advanced series
in a direction, and with chemotypes, that had not been previously
explored or imagined. This overcame what had been an unsurmounted barrier in efficacy. Not only was the resulting series
potent, with sub-nanomolar to mid-picomolar affinities, but also
it had clinically relevant MIC values and activity in a mouse model of bacterial infection. In short, beginning with a structural study
and guided synthesis, we ended up with molecules active in vivo
in a mammalian system. In themselves, these inhibitors hold
promise as leads to overcome a pervasive and growing threat to
public health. More generally, whereas fragments are widely used
to nucleate early discovery (13–22), this study suggests that they
also may be used to guide late-stage optimization into chemotypes and geometries that would be hard to systematically sample
by other methods.
Methods
Modeling of Distal Site Binders. Boronic acids were modeled manually and
subsequently minimized using PLOP (41) (SI Appendix, Supporting Methods).
Synthesis. Sulfonamidomethaneboronic acids (1–10) were obtained from
functionalized sulfonyl chlorides. Microwave assisted cycloaddition yielded
tetrazoles 4–8 (SI Appendix, Supporting Methods).
Enzymology. Enzyme inhibition was measured by the method of initial rates
(SI Appendix, Supporting Methods).
Crystallography. All AmpC/inhibitor X-ray structures were obtained by
co-crystallization and determined by molecular replacement (SI Appendix,
Supporting Methods). The atomic coordinates and structure factors for AmpC
with compounds 3–8 and 10 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank
(PDB), www.rcsb.org (PDB ID codes 4E3I, 4E3J, 4E3K, 4E3L, 4E3M, 4E3N, 4E3O).
Microbiology. Susceptibility testing followed the guidelines of CLSI (34). Each
MIC value reported reflects the average of three independent experiments
(SI Appendix, Supporting Methods).
In Vivo Efficacy Studies. The experiments were approved by the Animal Care
Committee of Auvergne University, Clermont-Ferrand, France (SI Appendix,
Supporting Methods).
