Besides thriving on altered glucose metabolism, cancer cells undergo glutaminolysis to meet their energy demands. As the ﬁrst
enzyme in catalyzing glutaminolysis, human kidney-type glutaminase isoform (KGA) is becoming an attractive target for small
molecules such as BPTES [bis-2-(5 phenylacetamido-1, 2, 4-thiadiazol-2-yl) ethyl sulﬁde], although the regulatory mechanism of KGA
remains unknown. On the basis of crystal structures, we reveal that
BPTES binds to an allosteric pocket at the dimer interface of KGA,
triggering a dramatic conformational change of the key loop
(Glu312-Pro329) near the catalytic site and rendering it inactive.
The binding mode of BPTES on the hydrophobic pocket explains its
speciﬁcity to KGA. Interestingly, KGA activity in cells is stimulated
by EGF, and KGA associates with all three kinase components of the
Raf-1/Mek2/Erk signaling module. However, the enhanced activity
is abrogated by kinase-dead, dominant negative mutants of Raf-1
(Raf-1-K375M) and Mek2 (Mek2-K101A), protein phosphatase PP2A,
and Mek-inhibitor U0126, indicative of phosphorylation-dependent
regulation. Furthermore, treating cells that coexpressed Mek2K101A and KGA with suboptimal level of BPTES leads to synergistic
inhibition on cell proliferation. Consequently, mutating the crucial
hydrophobic residues at this key loop abrogates KGA activity and
cell proliferation, despite the binding of constitutive active Mek2S222/226D. These studies therefore offer insights into (i) allosteric
inhibition of KGA by BPTES, revealing the dynamic nature of KGA’s
active and inhibitory sites, and (ii) cross-talk and regulation of KGA
activities by EGF-mediated Raf-Mek-Erk signaling. These ﬁndings
will help in the design of better inhibitors and strategies for the
treatment of cancers addicted with glutamine metabolism.

T

he Warburg effect in cancer biology describes the tendency of
cancer cells to take up more glucose than most normal cells,
despite the availability of oxygen (1, 2). In addition to altered
glucose metabolism, glutaminolysis (catabolism of glutamine to
ATP and lactate) is another hallmark of cancer cells (2, 3). In
glutaminolysis, mitochondrial glutaminase catalyzes the conversion of glutamine to glutamate (4), which is further catabolized
in the Krebs cycle for the production of ATP, nucleotides, certain amino acids, lipids, and glutathione (2, 5).
Humans express two glutaminase isoforms: KGA (kidney-type)
and LGA (liver-type) from two closely related genes (6). Although
KGA is important for promoting growth, nothing is known about
the precise mechanism of its activation or inhibition and how its
functions are regulated under physiological or pathophysiological
conditions. Inhibition of rat KGA activity by antisense mRNA
results in decreased growth and tumorigenicity of Ehrlich ascites
tumor cells (7), reduced level of glutathione, and induced apoptosis
(8), whereas Myc, an oncogenic transcription factor, stimulates
KGA expression and glutamine metabolism (5). Interestingly, direct suppression of miR23a and miR23b (9) or activation of TGF-β
(10) enhances KGA expression. Similarly, Rho GTPase that
controls cytoskeleton and cell division also up-regulates KGA expression in an NF-κB–dependent manner (11). In addition, KGA is
www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1116573109

a substrate for the ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/
cyclosome (APC/C)-Cdh1, linking glutaminolysis to cell cycle
progression (12). In comparison, function and regulation of LGA is
not well studied, although it was recently shown to be linked to p53
pathway (13, 14). Although intense efforts are being made to develop a speciﬁc KGA inhibitor such as BPTES [bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1, 2, 4-thiadiazol-2-yl) ethyl sulﬁde] (15), its mechanism
of inhibition and selectivity is not yet understood. Equally important is to understand how KGA function is regulated in normal and
cancer cells so that a better treatment strategy can be considered.
The previous crystal structures of microbial (Mglu) and
Escherichia coli glutaminases show a conserved catalytic domain of
KGA (16, 17). However, detailed structural information and regulation are not available for human glutaminases especially the
KGA, and this has hindered our strategies to develop inhibitors.
Here we report the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of
human apo KGA and its complexes with substrate (L-glutamine),
product (L-glutamate), BPTES, and its derived inhibitors. Further,
Raf-Mek-Erk module is identiﬁed as the regulator of KGA activity. Although BPTES is not recognized in the active site, its binding
confers a drastic conformational change of a key loop (Glu312Pro329), which is essential in stabilizing the catalytic pocket. Signiﬁcantly, EGF activates KGA activity, which can be abolished by
the kinase-dead, dominant negative mutants of Mek2 (Mek2K101A) or its upstream activator Raf-1 (Raf-1-K375M), which are
the kinase components of the growth-promoting Raf-Mek2-Erk
signaling node. Furthermore, coexpression of phosphatase PP2A
and treatment with Mek-speciﬁc inhibitor or alkaline phosphatase
all abolished enhanced KGA activity inside the cells and in vitro,
indicating that stimulation of KGA is phosphorylation dependent.
Our results therefore provide mechanistic insights into KGA inhibition by BPTES and its regulation by EGF-mediated Raf-MekErk module in cell growth and possibly cancer manifestation.

proximity to the bound ligand. In the apo structure, two water
molecules were located in the active site, one of them being displaced by glutamine in the substrate complex. The substrate side
chain is within hydrogen-bonding distance (2.9 Å) to the active site
Ser286. Other key residues involved in catalysis, such as Lys289,
Tyr414, and Tyr466, are in the vicinity of the active site. Lys289 is
within hydrogen-bonding distance to Ser286 (3.1 Å) and acts as
a general base for the nucleophilic attack by accepting the proton
from Ser286. Tyr466, which is close to Ser286 and in hydrogenbonding contact (3.2 Å) with glutamine, is involved in proton
transfer during catalysis. Moreover, the carbonyl oxygen of the
glutamine is hydrogen-bonded with the main chain amino groups
of Ser286 and Val484, forming the oxyanion hole. Thus, we propose that in addition to the putative catalytic dyad (Ser286 XX
Lys289), Tyr466 could play an important role in the catalysis (Fig.
1C and Fig. S2).

The structure of cKGA has two domains with the active site
located at the interface. Domain I comprises (Ile221-Pro281
and Cys424 -Leu533) of a ﬁve-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet
(β2↓β1↑β5↓β4↑β3↓) surrounded by six α-helices and several loops.
The domain II (Phe282-Thr423) mainly consists of seven α-helices. L-Glutamine/L-glutamate is bound in the active site cleft (Fig.
1B and Fig. S1B). Overall the active site is highly basic, and the
bound ligand makes several hydrogen-bonding contacts to
Gln285, Ser286, Asn335, Glu381, Asn388, Tyr414, Tyr466, and
Val484 (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1C), and these residues are highly
conserved among KGA homologs (Fig. S1D). Notably, the putative serine-lysine catalytic dyad (286-SCVK-289), corresponding
to the SXXK motif of class D β-lactamase (17), is located in close

Allosteric Binding Pocket for BPTES. The crystal structure of cKGA:
BPTES complex shows that BPTES occupies a previously unsuspected allosteric pocket, in the solvent-exposed region at the
dimer interface of cKGA, located ≈18 Å away from the active site
serine (Ser286) (Fig. 2A). The chemical structure of BPTES has an
internal symmetry, with two exactly equivalent parts including
a thiadiazole, amide, and a phenyl group (Fig. S3A), and it equally
interacts with each monomer. The thiadiazole group and the aliphatic linker are well buried in a hydrophobic cluster that consists
of Leu321, Phe322, Leu323, and Tyr394 from both monomers,
which forms the allosteric pocket (Fig. 2 B–E). The side chain of
Phe322 is found at the bottom of the allosteric pocket. The phenylacetamido moiety of BPTES is partially exposed on the loop
(Asn324-Glu325), where it interacts with Phe318, Asn324, and the
aliphatic part of the Glu325 side chain. On the basis of our
observations we synthesized a series of BPTES-derived inhibitors
(compounds 2–5) (Fig. S3 A–F and SI Results) and solved their
cocrystal structure of compounds 2–4. Similar to BPTES, compounds 2–4 all resides within the hydrophobic cluster of the allosteric pocket (Fig. S3 C–F).The side chain of Tyr394, backbone

Allosteric Binding of BPTES Triggers Major Conformational Change in
the Key Loop Near the Active Site. The overall structure of these

inhibitor complexes superimposes well with apo cKGA. However,
a major conformational change at the Glu312 to Pro329 loop was
observed in the BPTES complex (Fig. 2F). The most conformational changes of the backbone atoms that moved away from the
active site region are found at the center of the loop (Leu316Lys320). The backbone of the residues Phe318 and Asn319 is
moved ≈9 Å and ≈7 Å, respectively, compared with the apo
structure, whereas the side chain of these residues moved ≈14 Å
and ≈12 Å, respectively. This loop rearrangement in turn brings
Phe318 closer to the phenyl group of the inhibitor and forms the
inhibitor binding pocket, whereas in the apo structure the same
loop region (Leu316-Lys320) was found to be adjacent to the
active site and forms a closed conformation of the active site.
Speciﬁcally, in apo structure Phe318 makes hydrophobic interactions with Tyr466, and side chain of the Asn319 makes hydrogen-bonding contact with backbone of the Asn335 (≈2.8 Å).
Notably, the residues Tyr466 and Asn335 are involved in binding
to L-glutamine and catalysis. These observations suggest that
binding of BPTES induces conformational changes of the key
residues of the loop (Glu312-Pro329) to stabilize an open and
inactive conformation of the catalytic site. Fig. S4 A and B show
the electrostatic surface potential of the open and closed conformation of active site. Besides, we have determined the cKGA–
glutamate–BPTES structure and revealed similar conformational
changes, suggesting that BPTES can stabilize an inactive glutamate-bound form of the enzyme (Fig. S4C). This result is consistent with previous kinetics studies showing that BPTES, which is
an uncompetitive inhibitor, can inhibit both the enzyme–substrate
or enzyme–product complex (15).
Binding of BPTES Stabilizes the Inactive Tetramers of cKGA. To understand the role of oligomerization in KGA function, dimers and
tetramers of cKGA were generated using the symmetry-related
monomers (Fig. 2 A–E and Fig. S4 D and E). The dimer interface
in the cKGA: BPTES complex is formed by residues from the helix
Asp386-Lys398 of both monomers and involves hydrogen bonding, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions (Phe389, Ala390,
Tyr393, and Tyr394), besides two sulfate ions located in the interface (Fig. 2E). The dimers are further stabilized by binding of
BPTES, where it binds to loop residues (Glu312-Pro329) and
Tyr394 from both monomers (Fig. 2 D and E). Similarly, residues
from Lys311-Asn319 loop and Arg454, His461, Gln471, and
Asn529-Leu533 are involved in the interface with neighboring
monomers to form the tetramer in the BPTES complex. The
interactions among the monomers are relatively weaker in the apo
tetramer than in the BPTES complex (Fig. S4 D and E). We infer
that the binding of BPTES promotes the formation of a stable but
inactive tetramer.
BPTES Induces Allosteric Conformational Changes That Destabilize
Catalytic Function of KGA. Subsequently we examined how BPTES

binding could inhibit KGA activity by comparing the structures of
the cKGA: BPTES inhibitor complex with the apo cKGA structure.
Because the loop Glu312-Pro329 is located near the active site, we
hypothesize that BPTES binding induces conformational changes
of the key residues of the loop (Glu312-Pro329) to stabilize an open
and inactive conformation of the catalytic site. To test this hypothesis, wild-type KGA and structure-guided KGA mutants
Thangavelu et al.

Phe318Ala, Leu321Ala, Phe322Ala, and Leu323Ala, as well as
a Tyr394Ala variant from the dimerization helix, were each
expressed in human embryonic kidney epithelial cells 293T at equal
levels, and homeostasis levels of glutamate inside the cells were
determined. Fig. 3A shows that 293T cells overexpressing KGA
produced higher level of glutamate compared with the vector control cells. Most signiﬁcantly, all of these mutants, except Phe322Ala,
greatly diminished the KGA activity.
Next, we examined whether these residues are speciﬁcally involved in stabilizing the BPTES–KGA interactions. Unlike all of
the previous mutants that have Ala substitutions to knock out their
direct contribution to the actual enzymatic activities, a set of
recombinant cKGA mutants (Phe318Tyr, Phe322Ser, Phe318Tyr/
Phe322Ser, and Tyr394Ile) were instead generated to test their
BPTES sensitivity. In particular, Phe318Tyr/Phe322Ser double
mutant was used to mimic the corresponding residues in the liver
form of glutaminase, LGA. Results show that all these mutants
still retain the same KGA activity as the wild-type control (Fig.
S7A). However, the three mutants Phe322Ser or Phe318Tyr/
Phe322Ser and Tyr394Ile showed signiﬁcantly reduced sensitivity
to BPTES (1,140-, 970-, and 910-fold, respectively) (Fig. 3B). In
contrast, Phe318Tyr, which retains the aromatic ring and is still
active, remains highly sensitive to BPTES. In summary, consistent
with our structural analysis, all of the key residues in the loop
Glu312 to Pro329 and Tyr394 are essential for conferring KGA
activity, and at least Phe322 and Tyr394 are involved in stabilizing
the BPTES–KGA interaction. Any conformational change upon
BPTES binding would severely affect the stability of the catalytic
core of KGA, hence affecting its activity.

amide of the Phe322 and Leu323, makes hydrogen-bonding contacts to inhibitors. Moreover, the residues Leu321 and Phe322
ﬂipped out ≈180° to enhance the hydrophobic interactions with
the inhibitors. Thus, the conformational changes are required to
form the allosteric pocket. Further kinetic studies showed that
compounds 2–5 inhibit cKGA to a lesser extent than BPTES (Fig.
S3B), and we propose that the binding speciﬁcity of BPTES is
dictated by the thiadiazole, amide, and the hydrophobic linker
regions, whereas the potency is primarily determined by the
presence of phenyl rings at both ends. Thus, BPTES was subsequently used to further delineate the structural, functional, and
regulation aspects of KGA.

Raf-Mek-Erk Signaling Module Regulates KGA Activity. Because
KGA supports cell growth and proliferation, we ﬁrst validated
that treatment of cells with BPTES indeed inhibits KGA activity
and cell proliferation (Fig. S5 A–D and SI Results). Next, as cells
respond to various physiological stimuli to regulate their metabolism, with many of the metabolic enzymes being the primary
targets of modulation (18), we examined whether KGA activity
can be regulated by physiological stimuli, in particular EGF,
which is important for cell growth and proliferation. Cells

overexpressing KGA were made quiescent and then stimulated
with EGF for various time points. Fig. 4A shows that the basal
KGA activity remained unchanged 30 min after EGF stimulation,
but the activity was substantially enhanced after 1 h and then
gradually returned to the basal level after 4 h. Because EGF
activates the Raf-Mek-Erk signaling module (19), treatment of
cells with Mek-speciﬁc inhibitor U0126 could block the enhanced
KGA activity with parallel inhibition of Erk phosphorylation (Fig.
4A). Interestingly, such Mek-induced KGA activity is speciﬁc to

Discussion
Small-molecule inhibitors that target glutaminase activity in cancer
cells are under development. Earlier efforts targeting glutaminase
using glutamine analogs have been unsuccessful owing to their
toxicities (2). BPTES has attracted much attention as a selective,
nontoxic inhibitor of KGA (15), and preclinical testing of BPTES
toward human cancers has just begun (20). BPTES selectively
suppresses the growth of glioma cells (21) and inhibits the growth
of lymphoma tumor growth in animal model studies (22). Wang
et al. (11) reported a small molecule that targets glutaminase activity and oncogenic transformation. Despite extensive studies,
nothing is known about the structural and molecular basis for KGA
inhibitory mechanisms and how their function is regulated during
normal and cancer cell metabolism. Such limited information

pathway, as evidenced by the inhibition of KGA activity by the kinase-dead
and dominant negative mutants of Raf-1 (Raf-1-K375M) and Mek2 (Mek2K101A), protein phosphatase PP2A, and Mek-speciﬁc inhibitor U0126. Consequently, inhibiting KGA with BPTES and blocking Raf-Mek pathway with
Mek2-K101A provide a synergistic inhibition on cell proliferation. Refer to

better treatment regimens.
Comparison of the complex structures with apo cKGA structure, which has well-deﬁned electron density for the key loop, we
provide the atomic view of an allosteric binding pocket for
BPTES and elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of KGA by
BPTES. The key residues of the loop (Glu312-Pro329) undergo
major conformational changes upon binding of BPTES. In addition, structure-based mutagenesis studies suggest that this loop
is essential for stabilizing the active site. Therefore, by binding in
an allosteric pocket, BPTES inhibits the enzymatic activity of
KGA through (i) triggering a major conformational change on
the key residues that would normally be involved in stabilizing
the active sites and regulating its enzymatic activity; and (ii)
forming a stable inactive tetrameric KGA form. Our ﬁndings are

EGF and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) but not with other growth
factors, such as PDGF, TGF-β, and basic FGF (bFGF), despite
activation of Mek-Erk by bFGF (Fig. S6A). We next investigated
whether Raf-Mek-Erk activated by EGF could indeed directly
regulate the KGA activity. Cells were transfected with KGA with
wild-type, the “dominant negative and kinase-dead,” or the constitutive active mutants of Raf-1 and Mek2 and the levels of glutamate determined. Strikingly, KGA activity was completely
inhibited by both the dominant negative mutants of Raf-1
(K375M) and Mek2 (K101A), whereas both wild-type and constitutive active mutants of Raf-1 (Raf-1-Y340D) and Mek2
(Mek2-S222, 226D) did not lead to any further increase in the
glutamate production (Fig. 4B). Moreover, expression of these
mutants did not affect the expression levels of either ectopically
expressed or the endogenous level of KGA (Fig. 4C and Fig. S6B),
indicating that any changes in the KGA activity was not due to
their protein stability but was due to some posttranslational
modiﬁcations of KGA. To examine whether such regulation is
directly associated with the Raf-Mek-Erk complex, overexpressd
KGA was immunoprecipitated from the cells, and the presence of
Raf-1, Mek2, or Erk1/2 (endogenous or overexpressed) was examined. The results show that KGA could interact equally well
with the wild-type or mutant forms of Raf-1 and Mek2 (Fig. 4C).
Importantly, endogenous Raf-1 or Erk1/2, including the phosphorylated Erk1/2 (Fig. 4 C and D), could be detected in the KGA
complex. Taken together, these results indicate that the activity of
KGA is directly regulated by Raf-Mek-Erk downstream of EGF
receptor. To further show that Mek2-enhanced KGA activity
requires both the kinase activity of Mek2 and the core residues for
KGA catalysis, wild-type or triple mutant (Leu321Ala/Phe322Ala/
Leu323Ala) of KGA was coexpressed with dominant negative
Mek2-KA or the constitutive active Mek2-SD and their KGA
activities measured. The result shows that the presence of Mek2KA blocks KGA activity, whereas the triple mutant still remains
inert even in the presence of the constitutively active Mek2 (Fig.
4E), and despite Mek2 binding to the KGA triple mutant (Fig.
S7B). Consequently, expressing triple mutant did not support cell
proliferation as well as the wild-type control (Fig. S7C).
Interestingly, when cells expressing both KGA and Mek2K101A were treated with subthreshold levels of BPTES, there was
a synergistic reduction in cell proliferation (Fig. S6C and SI
Results). Lastly, to determine whether regulation of KGA by RafMek-Erk depends on its phosphorylation status, cells were transfected with KGA with or without the protein phosphatase PP2A
and assayed for the KGA activity. PP2A is a ubiquitous and conserved serine/threonine phosphatase with broad substrate speciﬁcity. The results indicate that KGA activity was reduced down to
the basal level in the presence of PP2A (Fig. 5A). Coimmunoprecipitation study also revealed that KGA interacts with PP2A
(Fig. 5B), suggesting a negative feedback regulation by this protein
phosphatase. Furthermore, treatment of immunoprecipitated and
puriﬁed KGA with calf-intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP)
almost completely abolished the KGA activity in vitro (Fig. S6D).
Taken together, these results indicate that KGA activity is regulated by Raf-Mek2, and KGA activation by EGF could be part of
the EGF-stimulated Raf-Mek-Erk signaling program in controlling cell growth and proliferation (Fig. 5C).

further supported by two very recent reports on KGA isoform
(GAC) (23, 24), although these studies lack full details owing to
limitation of their electron density maps. BPTES is speciﬁc to
KGA but not to LGA (15). Sequence comparison of KGA with
LGA (Fig. S8A) reveals two unique residues on KGA, Phe318
and Phe322, which upon mutation to LGA counterparts, become
resistant to BPTES. Thus, our study provides the molecular basis
of BPTES speciﬁcity.
It was recently reported that KGA is up-regulated by Myc and
Rho and is subjected to ubiquitination (9, 11, 12). However, little
is known regarding how the glutaminolytic pathway is functionally
linked to growth-promoting signaling pathway(s). Many metabolic
enzymes are thought to serve as housekeeping enzymes that
control ﬂuxes of metabolites to sustain rather than to primarily
regulate cell growth. Here we show that a high level of KGA activity can lead to the increased cell proliferation that is inhibited by
BPTES. Most signiﬁcantly, we show that KGA activity is activated
by EGF via the Raf-Mek-Erk signaling module because inhibition
of both kinases by their dominant negative mutants or treatment
with a speciﬁc Mek inhibitor completely abrogates the KGA activity. Consistent with the regulation being phosphorylation-dependent, coexpressing KGA with protein phosphatase PP2A or
treatment of puriﬁed KGA with alkaline phosphatase all block the
elevated KGA activity. When key residues on the loop that stabilizes the catalytic core of KGA are mutated, such stimulation is
lost. These results indicate that Raf-Mek-Erk signaling is linked to
reprogramming of growth metabolism.
We show that the combined inhibitory effect of Mek2 and
BPTES on KGA and cell proliferation could offer an exciting regime for multidrug therapy in cancers. Understanding how KGA
itself is activated by the Raf-Mek signaling will also provide an
alternative approach to further examine whether deregulation of
KGA and its hyperactivation can be linked to this pathway. This
could be the basis for abnormal cell growth in cancers and possibly
other metabolic and neuronal disorders involving glutamate or
ammonia as a main metabolite, such as hyperinsulinism/ hyperammonemia/hepatic encephalopathy and neurotransmission (25,
26). In this regard, we show that KGA forms a complex with Raf-1,
Mek2, and Erk1/2, as well as the protein phosphatase PP2A, which

can be anchored on a common scaffold protein or present as different subcomplexes. Whether this activation would involve KGA
directly as a substrate of Raf-1, Mek2, or/and Erk or whether other
immediate substrate(s) of these kinases exist to act as a coregulator
for KGA remains to be further investigated. This is of particular
interest because we show that bFGF, despite activating Mek/Erk,
does not activate the KGA activity. This result highlights tight
regulation of these three-tier kinases that could be spatially coordinated through different scaffolds or by other yet-unknown
coregulators. In addition, the domain II of cKGA is homologous to
several DEATH domain-containing proteins (Fig. S8B), which are
known to regulate many signaling pathways, such as NF-κB and
apoptosis (27).
In summary, the current structural, biochemical, molecular,
and cell-based studies provide detailed insights into allosteric
inhibition of human KGA by BPTES, the regulation of KGA
activity and cell proliferation by EGF receptor-mediated Raf/
Mek/Erk signaling module, and phosphorylation-dependent regime in cancer cell metabolism. This could pave the way for
developing more speciﬁc therapeutic inhibitors toward KGA and
Mek2-linked pathways and may offer a more effective strategy to
tackle glutamine-addicted cancers with greater efﬁcacy.
