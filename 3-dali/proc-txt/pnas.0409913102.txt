In several species, GAF domains, which are widely expressed
small-molecule-binding domains that regulate enzyme activity, are
known to bind cyclic nucleotides. However, the molecular mechanism by which cyclic nucleotide binding affects enzyme activity is
not known for any GAF domain. In the cyanobacterium, Anabaena,
the cyaB1 and cyaB2 genes encode adenylyl cyclases that are
stimulated by binding of cAMP to their N-terminal GAF domains.
Replacement of the tandem GAF-A兾B domains in cyaB1 with the
mammalian phosphodiesterase 2A GAF-A兾B tandem domains allows regulation of the chimeric protein by cGMP, suggesting a
highly conserved mechanism of activation. Here, we describe the
1.9-Å crystal structure of the tandem GAF-A兾B domains of cyaB2
with bound cAMP and compare it to the previously reported
structure of the PDE2A GAF-A兾B. Unexpectedly, the cyaB2 GAF-A兾B
dimer is antiparallel, unlike the parallel dimer of PDE2A. Moreover,
there is clear electron density for cAMP in both GAF-A and -B,
whereas in PDE2A, cGMP is found only in GAF-B. Phosphate and
ribose group contacts are similar to those in PDE2A. However, the
purine-binding pockets appear very different from that in PDE2A
GAF-B. Differences in the ␤2–␤3 loop suggest that this loop confers
much of the ligand specificity in this and perhaps in many other
GAF domains. Finally, a conserved asparagine appears to be a new
addition to the signature NKFDE motif, and a mechanism for this
motif to stabilize the cNMP-binding pocket is proposed.
cAMP 兩 phosphodiesterase

G

AF domains (named for cyclic GMP, Adenylyl cyclase,
FhlA) are small-molecule-binding domains expressed in
many organisms that are important regulatory elements for a
host of different enzymes (1, 2). In mammals, GAF domains are
mostly found in cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs),
which are crucial cellular enzymes controlling cGMP and cAMP
second-messenger levels. Five of the 11 mammalian PDE families contain two GAF domains (PDE2, -5, -6, -10, and -11), all
in tandem and N-terminal to the catalytic domain (3–5). So far,
two separate functions, namely cyclic nucleotide binding and
dimerization, have been described for different PDE GAF
domains. In the cGMP-stimulated PDE2A, a crystallographic
study showed that it is the GAF-A domain that mediates protein
dimerization, whereas it is the GAF-B domain that binds a cyclic
nucleotide ligand (6). In contrast, in PDE5 and -6, GAF-A, but
not GAF-B, appears to possess both the ligand-binding (7) and
dimerization contacts (8, 9). The detailed mechanism by which
these GAF domains regulate the phosphodiesterase activities of
PDEs remains unclear.
The class III adenylyl cyclases (ACs) of the cyanobacterium
Anabaena, which are at least 2 billion years separated in evolution from mammals, also contain tandem GAF domains in their
N termini (10). The cyaB1 adenylyl cyclase has been shown to be
stimulated by its product, cAMP. This regulation is due to cAMP
binding and signaling to the catalytic domain via the GAF-B
domain (11). Another very similar adenylyl cyclase, cyaB2,
3082–3087 兩 PNAS 兩 February 22, 2005 兩 vol. 102 兩 no. 8

likewise is stimulated by cAMP [see the accompanying article
(12)]. Remarkably, a chimeric AC consisting of the PDE2 GAF
domains and the cyaB1 catalytic domain can be activated by
cGMP (11), suggesting that the tandem GAF domains in the
mammalian PDEs and the cyanobacterial AC share common
mechanisms for regulation of the enzymatic activities of their
neighboring catalytic domains.
Here, we report the 1.9-Å crystal structure of the tandem
GAF-A兾B domains from the Anabaena adenylyl cyclase cyaB2.
Surprisingly, the structure shows an antiparallel dimer, in contrast to the parallel PDE2A GAF-A兾B dimer, with both cyaB2
GAF domains involved in dimer formation. Moreover, cAMP is
found in complex with both GAF-A and -B. These structural
results have revealed previously uncharacterized modes of ligand
binding and dimerization for the tandem GAF domains, suggesting that their regulatory mechanisms are likely to involve
multiple states of structural configuration.
Materials and Methods
Crystallization. The cyaB2 GAF-A兾B residues 58–445-GSRS-H6
crystallizes in space group P1 with one dimer in the asymmetric
unit, Vm ⫽ 2.74 Å3兾Da, and a solvent content of 55.1%. The same
crystal form was grown with sulfomethionine (SuMet) and
selenomethionine (SeMet) protein at room temperature, using
sodium formate or ammonium sulfate as the precipitant. A fast
desalting column or Centricon 50 was used to exchange protein
into crystallization buffer (10 mM Tris䡠HCl, pH 7.5兾10% glycerol兾1 mM MgCl2兾1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol; no glycerol was
present for the ammonium sulfate crystals). Two millimolar
Na-cAMP was then added. The protein concentration was 10–12
mg兾ml. Sitting drops were set up in Cryschem plates from
Hampton Research. Drops were 4 ␮l of protein plus 4 ␮l of well
solution unless otherwise indicated. For the single-wavelength
anomalous dispersion (SAD) SeMet data set, the well was 0.5 ml
of 3.9 M Na formate and 100 mM bis-Tris propane (pH 9.0). For
the single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering
(SIRAS) data set, the SuMet crystal was grown from 3.8 M Na
formate (pH 8.8); the SeMet crystal was grown from 3.6 M Na
formate (pH 8.8). The crystal for a 1.9-Å ammonium sulfate data
set was grown by using a well of 1.60 M ammonium sulfate, 100
mM bis-Tris propane (pH 8.8), and 12% glycerol. For data
collection at 100 K, all crystals were frozen directly out of the
drop into liquid nitrogen.
Data Collection and Structure Determination. The structure was

solved by ␴A combination of two sets of phases from a 4.2-Å SAD

sets. After a fluorescent scan, the peak Se wavelength was
determined to be 12,657.6 eV (0.9795 Å) (1 eV ⫽ 1.602 ⫻ 10⫺19
J). An ⬇3.0-Å SAD data set was collected at Advanced Light
Source (ALS) beamline 5.0.2. Also, at ALS beamline 5.0.1
(1.0000 Å), the Na formate SIRAS (SuMet and SeMet) data sets
and an ammonium sulfate SuMet data set (for refinement) were
collected. Both 4.2-Å SAD and 3.0-Å SIRAS phases [from
SOLVE (13)] were fed into the CCP4 SIGMAA program (14). The
combined, weighted phases were fed into RESOLVE (15) with
twofold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging and solvent
flattening. The HA positions were supplied from the SIRAS
SOLVE run. The latter found 14 of the 18 Se sites (9 Se per
monomer, and 1 dimer per asymmetric unit). A model was built
manually with the program O (16). The model was refined with
a 1.9-Å ammonium sulfate native Met data set and the program
CNS (17), using restrained individual B factors, then with REFMAC
(14, 18), using TLS refinement. Continuous electron density is
present from the first residue, V58, to residue 440, except for a
few short loops. Residues 441–445 in chain A and 442–445 in
chain B, followed by the histidine tag GSRSH6, were disordered
and not included in the model. Cys-368 in chain A and Glu-213
in chain B were modeled as double conformers. The final free
R factor is 21.5%, and Rwork is 18.2%. Of the residues in the final
model, 93.7% are in the most favored area of the Ramachandran
plot (Table 1, which is published as supporting information on
the PNAS web site).

monomer, the GAF-A and -B domains have very similar structures with identical topology, except for the ␤2–␤3 loop, which
is central to purine binding, and the conserved signature NKFDE motif [a conserved signature motif of the amino acids
Asn(N), Lys(K), Phe(F), Asp(D), and Glu(E) found in all
GAF-domain-containing enzymes that have cyclic-nucleotidebinding capacity], which appears to be important for stabilization
of the cyclic-nucleotide-binding pocket (see below).
In the crystal, the cyaB2 dimer is arranged in an antiparallel
manner and adopts a highly compact overall shape. Like the
previously described PDE2A tandem GAF domains, the two
cyaB2 GAF domains are connected by a long helix (6). In each
cyaB2 monomer, the two GAF domains are located on the same
side of the connecting helix and likely contact each other through
a single salt bridge. A single monomer is 86 Å in the longest
dimension and thus about 15% shorter than the PDE2 GAF
monomer. This difference is due to a sharp backward bend of the
cyaB2 GAF-B domain toward the connecting helix (Fig. 1; see
also Fig. 7, which is published as supporting information on the
PNAS web site). Between the two monomers, dimerization
occurs mainly through the connecting helices, two N-terminal
helices of GAF-A, and one C-terminal helix of GAF-B, allowing
the GAF-A domain of one monomer to closely pack against the
GAF-B domain of the other. The total area buried in the dimer
interface is ⬇7,300 Å2. The maximum dimension of the dimer is
111 Å. Overall, the arrangement of the four GAF domains results
in a ‘‘flat’’ rectangular shape, although the two pairs of GAF-A,
B⬘ and GAF-B, A⬘ domains are in fact related by an ⬇30°
rotation around the connecting helix (Fig. 1b).

asymmetric unit (Fig. 1 a and b). This finding is consistent with
the results of the light-scattering analysis in conjunction with
size-exclusion chromatography showing that the protein also
forms a dimer in solution (data not shown). In each cyaB2

dimer of the GAF-A兾B from PDE2A (Fig. 1c). In the latter,
GAF-A is a dimerizing domain, whereas the GAF-B domains are
not in contact with each other (6). Within a monomer, the two
PDE2A GAF-A and -B domains are also far away from each
other. Although parts of the connecting helices in PDE2A play

Fig. 2. Close-up view of the cAMP-binding sites in GAF-A (a) and -B (b) from
AC cyaB2, chain A. There are four polar side chains directly contacting cAMP
(GAF-A: R103, T105, T176, and Q196; GAF-B: R291, T293, T363, and Q383). In
GAF-A, T172 hydroxyl group contacts cAMP through a water. In GAF-B, N359
and D356 side chains contact cAMP through a water molecule. Backbone
amides or carbonyls of two or five residues contact cAMP through a water
(GAF-A: A161 and A165; GAF-B: T309, K324, G328, D348, and A352). Depending on the GAF domain, there are three to four bound waters. Last are three
to four hydrophobic contacts (GAF-A: Ile-131, Leu-198, and Tyr-174; GAF-B:
Trp-295, Ile-308, I355, and Tyr-361). Helix ␣4 is partially (b) and strand ␤3 is

a role in mediating dimerization of the GAF-A domains, their
C-terminal portions gradually bifurcate. In contrast, the cyaB2
connecting helices run almost in parallel over their entire length,
creating an expanded interaction surface of 1,318 Å2 (Fig. 1a).
The sequence identity between the connecting helices, which are
of essentially identical length, is low (16%, 6 of 37 residues),
suggesting that the specific dimerization modes observed in the
two cases might be unique to each individual protein. This is
particularly true for the intermolecular disulfide bond formed by
PDE2 Cys-386, whose corresponding residue in cyaB2 is an
alanine.
The cyaB2 GAF-A and -B Domains Share a Similar Cyclic-NucleotideBinding Fold. Each GAF-A and -B has a bound cAMP that is

in the anti-conformation, as is cGMP in PDE2A GAF-B (6).

cyaB2 GAF-A and -B, chain A. The figure was prepared with LIGPLOT (27).

Because the cAMP-binding sites in GAF-A and -B are very
similar (Figs. 2 and 3), only the GAF-B in chain A is chosen for
discussion here. With the exception of the purine part of the
binding pocket, cyaB2 GAF-B is generally similar to PDE2A
GAF-B with bound cGMP. The most unexpected difference is
the H-bond from Arg-291 to the N1 of cAMP (Fig. 2b). This
would appear to be an important residue for cAMP binding
because Arg-291 cannot H-bond to a protonated N1 in guanine.
This H-bond is therefore likely to be a positive determinant for
cAMP. The counterpart of Arg-291 in PDE2A GAF-B is Ile-422,
which contacts the guanine ring. The orientation of Arg-291
appears to be constrained by the side chains of two other
residues. From C␥ up through the guanidinium group, the side

Conserved NKFDE Motif. Both cyaB2 GAF domains contain the
conserved NKFDE motif found in all PDE tandem GAF domains (19). Consistent with the previously reported PDE2A
GAF structures, the NKFDE motif in the cyaB2 GAF domains
is not part of the binding pocket or dimer interface. However,
superpositioning of the three cAMP or cGMP-bound GAF
structures shows that these conserved sequences are accompanied by a conserved network of H-bonds, a conserved salt bridge,
and a mutual proximity of the NKFDE residues (Fig. 4; also see
Fig. 8 and Table 2, which are published as supporting informaMartinez et al.

cAMP is green, and T363 is magenta.

tion on the PNAS web site). The cyaB2 GAF-B structure will be
used to illustrate. In this structure, Asn-386 is buried and forms
H-bonds with the backbone of the residue preceding and the two
residues following Thr-363 that in turn forms an H-bond to the
ribose 2⬘ OH of the cyclic nucleotide. The salt bridge between
Lys-387 and Asp-416 is not isolated, as the Lys amino group and
Asp carboxyl group also make H-bonds to the backbone carbonyl
of Met-287 and the backbone amide of Asp-413, respectively.
The backbone carbonyl of Phe-412 itself forms an H-bond to the
side chain amide of an Asn (Table 2 and Fig. 4; Asn-151 and
Asn-338 in cyaB2 GAF-A and B; Asn-413 in PDE2 GAF-B). This
Asn is very well conserved in PDE and cyclase GAF domains and
perfectly conserved in all seven GAF domains that have been
shown experimentally to bind cyclic nucleotide (Fig. 6). Therefore, the canonical NKFDE motif may be extended to an
NNKFDE motif because the first Asn is conserved in all GAF
domains known to bind cyclic nucleotide. All six residues form
a continuous cluster in cyaB2 and PDE2 (Fig. 4). In this motif,
the Glu shows the most variability in contacts. It interacts with
a nearby Asn in PDE2A GAF-B and cyaB2 GAF-B but is
solvent-exposed in cyaB2 GAF-A.
Noticeably, the cyaB2 sequences containing the NKFDE motif
are distinct from that of PDE2A by having a much longer loop
between the Asn-Lys and the Phe (19 residues in cyaB2 GAF-A
and 24 in GAF-B versus 5 residues in PDE2A GAF-B). In cyaB2
GAF-A, the loop points away from the cyclic-nucleotide-binding
site, but in GAF-B, the loop lies on top of the ␣4-helix, which
makes several contacts to cAMP.
Discussion
Dimerization. The antiparallel dimerization of GAF-A and -B is

in complete contrast to the parallel dimer of the GAF-A兾B from
PDE2A (Fig. 1 a and c). In the latter, GAF-A is a dimerizing
domain, and only GAF-B binds cGMP (6). Moreover, electron
micrograph reconstructions of PDE5 and PDE6 also show
parallel dimers, albeit at a much lower resolution (28 Å) (8, 20).
Therefore, it appears that there can be more than one type of
dimerization interface for GAF proteins.

chain of Arg-291 is nearly flat against the side chain of Tyr-361,
at a distance of 3.6 Å, whereas the carbonyl oxygen of the
Gln-310 side chain makes a long 3.3-Å H-bond to NH1 of
Arg-291. In GAF-A, Tyr-361 is conserved as Tyr-174. Gln-310
does not have a counterpart in GAF-A because it is in the ␤2–␤3
loop that varies between GAF-A and -B.
Two residues after Arg-291, Thr-293 forms direct 2.8- and
2.7-Å H-bonds to the cAMP N6 and N7. In PDE2A, the
equivalent Ser-424 makes a 2.7-Å H-bond to N7 of cGMP. In
either cyclase GAF domain, the conformation of this side chain
is turned ⬇130° to allow H-bonds of similar length to both N6
and N7.
There are two side chains that contact cAMP through a water.
These include Asp-356 and Asn-359 that contact cAMP via
HOH10 to the N3 position of cAMP. These residues are
conserved in PDE2A GAF-B as Asp-485 and Thr-488 that
coordinate to HOH1, which makes an H-bond to both the N2
amino group and N3 of cGMP. Therefore, a water molecule in
this position is conserved in all three GAF domains. In the cyaB2
GAF-A, the equivalent residues are Glu-169, Thr-172, and
HOH73. However, Glu-169, probably due to steric clash from its
longer side chain, is turned away from the cAMP, exposing the
carboxyl group to solvent.
In PDE2A, Asp-439 makes an H-bond with its side chain to
cGMP N1, and also with its backbone amide to the O6 carbonyl
(6). The preceding Phe-438 base stacks with the guanine ring. In
cyaB2 GAF-B, the equivalent residues are Ile-308 and Thr-309.
However, the backbone of these residues is shifted away from the
cAMP (Fig. 5). Ile-308 cannot base stack but still makes a
hydrophobic contact to the adenine ring, and Thr-309 is too far
away for an H-bond. In cyaB2 GAF-A, the equivalent residues
are Ala-121 and Ala-122. These residues overlap reasonably well
in the structural alignment with their PDE2A counterparts. The
amide of Ala-122 (chain A) is 3.4 Å from N6, at van der Waals
distance. Instead, the carbonyl makes a 3.0-Å H-bond. The loop
has a less well defined density, but the backbone density is
continuous except for short gaps on either side of the Ala-122
carbonyl.
In PDE2A, the 2⬘ hydroxyl makes an H-bond with Thr-492 (6).
Although this is absolutely conserved as Thr-176 and Thr-363 in
cyaB2 GAF-A and -B, 2⬘-deoxy-cAMP is as effective an activator
as is cAMP itself (data not shown). Therefore, the functional
significance of this conserved ensemble presently remains unresolved. In PDE2A, another contact of the 2⬘ hydroxyl is to
HOH2, anchored by the Asp-485 backbone amide and Tyr-481
carbonyl. There is no equivalent water in either cyclase GAF-A
or -B. The ribose has a C3⬘-endo puckering configuration in both
PDE2A and the cyclase.
The 1.9-Å cyaB2 structure allows a high-resolution look at the
binding of the cyclic phosphate. Overall, it is similar to that of
cGMP in PDE2A GAF-B. The helix dipole ␣3 points to the
phosphate group. The equatorial and axial oxygens form Hbonds to the sequential residues Ile-139 and Ala-140 in GAF-A
and Phe-326 and Ala-327 in GAF-B. Both of these residues are
at the N terminus of helix ␣3. The density shows clearly that
cAMP is in the chair phosphoester conformation in both GAF-A
and -B.

A兾B chain A (231–263) and the PDE2A GAF-A兾B chain
(367–398) (one chain in the asymmetric unit; see Fig. 7) shows
these helices to be similar, but the GAF domains are disposed
quite differently about them. The GAF-B domain of cyaB2 is
tilted much closer to the connecting helix than in PDE2. The
difference is due to the linker residues 399–402 in PDE2, which
have a different conformation than the equivalent linker residues

bind cAMP is also in contrast to what is seen with the PDE2A
GAF domains. Nevertheless, the general topologies of the
binding sites are similar between the GAF-B domain of PDE2A
and either GAF domain of cyaB2. However, upon closer inspection, three differences are apparent. First, in PDE2A, the
phosphoester ring was modeled in the boat conformation.
Although, at a 2.9-Å resolution it was difficult to project the
correct conformation, the chair conformation was rejected
because the equatorial oxygen would have become axial, and
within H-bonding distance of the carboxyl of Glu-512. Because
presumably both of these oxygens are negatively charged, this
would have caused an electrostatic repulsion. In the cyaB2
cyclase, Glu-512 is Gln-196 in GAF-A or Gln-383 in GAF-B,
removing charge repulsion.
The second major structural difference between the PDE2A
and the cyclase GAF domains is in the ␤2–␤3 loop that may be
important for ligand binding and possibly specificity (Fig. 5). In
PDE2A, this loop contains Phe-438–Asp-439, which base stack
with the guanine ring and form H-bonds to the N1 nitrogen,
respectively (6). In cyaB2 GAF-A, Asp is Ala-122, whose carbonyl makes an H-bond to the N6 amino group. In GAF-B, the
carbonyl of Thr-309 H-bonds to a water which itself H-bonds to
N6. A superposition of these loops (Fig. 5) shows a variety of
conformations. An alignment of GAF sequences known to bind
cGMP or cAMP (Fig. 6) shows that this loop is the most variable
part of the GAF domain in sequence and length and therefore
may provide a major role in determining ligand specificity of the
site.
The third major difference is in Arg-291 in GAF-B (or Arg-103
in GAF-A) that makes a 3.2- to 3.3-Å contact to N1 of cAMP.

For the homologous cyaB1, a mutation in the NKFDE motif implicates GAF-B in cAMP binding (11). For the PDE5A (7), PDE6C (9), and T. brucei PDE2B, individually
expressed GAF-A domains have been studied with the filter-binding assay. The blue background denotes 50% or more identity. Lower conservation is denoted

Activation Mechanism. So far, little biochemical data are available

for the cyaB2 AC holoenyzme, because of difficulties in expression. However, the highly similar cyaB1 AC has been enzymatically characterized and shown to be activated by cAMP binding
to its GAF-B domains (11). A chimera containing the tandem
GAF-A兾B domains from cyaB2 and the cyaB1 AC is activated
almost exclusively by cAMP with an EC50 of ⬇1 ␮M [see
accompanying manuscript (12)]. Also, chimeras containing the
tandem GAF-A兾B domains from rat PDE2A or PDE5 could be
activated by cGMP and not cAMP as in the native PDE
holoenzymes (ref. 11 and unpublished data). These chimeras
present a puzzle in light of the structure reported here. The
mouse PDE2A GAF-A兾B structure is a parallel dimer, with
GAF-A dimerizing with itself, and the two cGMP-binding
GAF-B domains spaced 65 Å apart. In the cyaB2 GAF-A兾B
antiparallel dimer reported here, GAF-A dimerizes with GAF-B
of the opposite monomer. Furthermore, both GAF domains bind
cAMP. At present it is difficult to see how such a radically
different dimerization will be compatible with the activation
mechanism in the cyaB1 AC chimeras. Although both holoenzymes are activated by cyclic nucleotide binding to one or more
GAF domains, the different dimerization mechanisms would
suggest different activation mechanisms, yet we know that the
PDE2A and PDE5 GAF-A兾B can activate the cyaB1 adenylyl
cyclase. One possibility is that in both cases the catalytic domain
directly contacts a GAF domain regardless of whether the dimer
is parallel or antiparallel (or whether there is an intervening PAS
domain as in the cyclase). Another possibility is that both parallel

and antiparallel conformations provide a similar movement of
their C termini upon binding of the cyclic nucleotide that is
transduced to the respective catalytic domains. In this case, the
orientation of the dimers would not be important for activation.
Conserved NKFDE Motif. The NKFDE motif is found in GAF
domains of cyclases and phosphodiesterases, enzymes intrinsic to
cyclic nucleotide signaling. A role of this motif in binding cyclic
nucleotide is supported by several publications describing the
effects of several mutations to the motif, nearly all to Ala. In a
chimera containing PDE6 GAF-A兾B and PDE5 catalytic domain, an Asn-to-Ala mutation in either GAF domain abolished
noncatalytic cGMP binding (22). The Asp to Ala mutation in
PDE5 in GAF-A or -B reduced affinity for cGMP (23). Asn, Lys,
and Asp mutations to Ala in GAF-A did likewise, except for Glu
to Ala, which had no effect (19). The Asp to Ala mutation in a
GST fusion of PDE5 GAF-A modestly decreased binding (21).
In PDE2A GAF-B, all five NKFDE residues were mutated to
Ala (24). Each one abolished binding of cGMP and cAMP.
Inspection of the conserved hydrogen bonding, the placement
of the salt bridge, and the proximity of the NKFDE motif
residues (Fig. 4; also see Fig. 8 and Table 2) in all three GAF
domain crystal structures with bound cyclic nucleotide (cyaB2
GAF-A and -B, and PDE2A GAF-B) show a number of conserved interactions. This conservation suggests that a general
role for the NKFDE motif is to hold the ␣4-helix and the ␣4–␤5
linker, which both close over the cAMP, in the proper orientation relative to the more rigid unit composed of the ␤-sheet, and
the ␣2 and ␣5 helices on the opposite side of the ␤-sheet. These
interactions are likely to be essential for closing the ␣4-helix over
the bound cNMP. Overall, the function of the NKFDE motif
would be to form the links that stabilize the closed conformation
of the nucleotide binding pocket. It may also have additional
roles in transmitting the conformation changes in the GAF
domains that must occur upon nucleotide binding that in turn
allow activation of the catalytic domains.

PHARMACOLOGY

Of the seven to eight side-chain contacts to cAMP in cyaB2, only
four are polar (GAF-B Arg-291, Thr-293, Thr-363, and Gln-383).
The latter three H-bond to common contacts on either cAMP or
cGMP. This leaves Arg-291 and its H-bond to the N1 of cAMP.
Because in this conformation it would not form an H-bond with
the protonated N1 of cGMP, it may well provide specificity for
cAMP. However, the presence of Arg at this position is probably
not a universal determinant of cAMP specificity because an Arg
also occurs in the corresponding position of GAF-A of PDE5A,
and of GAF-A of PDE6C, which are highly specific for cGMP
binding (9, 21).
