Signaling pathways in eukaryotic cells are often controlled by the
formation of specific signaling complexes, which are coordinated
by scaffold and adaptor proteins. Elucidating their molecular architecture is essential to understand the spatial and temporal
regulation of cellular signaling. p14 and MP1 form a tight (Kd ⴝ 12.8
nM) endosomal adaptor兾scaffold complex, which regulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Here, we present
the 1.9-Å crystal structure of a biologically functional p14兾MP1
complex. The overall topology of the individual MP1 and p14
proteins is almost identical, having a central five-stranded ␤-sheet
sandwiched between a two-helix and a one-helix layer. Formation
of the p14兾MP1 heterodimer proceeds by ␤-sheet augmentation
and yields a unique, almost symmetrical, complex with several
potential protein-binding sites on its surface. Mutational analysis
allowed identification of the p14 endosomal adaptor motif, which
seems to orient the complex relative to the endosomal membrane.
Two highly conserved and hydrophobic protein-binding sites are
located on the opposite ‘‘cytoplasmic’’ face of the p14兾MP1 heterodimer and might therefore function as docking sites for the
target proteins extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and MAPK兾
ERK kinase 1. Furthermore, detailed sequence analyses revealed
that MP1兾p14, together with profilins, define a protein superfamily
of small subcellular adaptor proteins, named ProflAP. Taken together, the presented work provides insight into the spatial regulation of MAPK signaling, illustrating how p14 and MP1 collaborate as an endosomal adaptor兾scaffold complex.

T

he process by which extracellular signals are transmitted
from the plasma membrane to specific intracellular sites is an
essential feature of cellular regulation. Regulatory mechanisms
exist to influence where and when signaling enzymes exert their
function in the cell. The identification of scaffold and adaptor
proteins, which help to recruit enzymes into localized signaling
complexes, provides a conceptual framework for the spatial and
temporal coordination of signal transduction. Despite their
overall importance, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that are used by scaffold and adaptor proteins to orchestrate signaling entities and to guarantee the translation of
extracellular signals into specific biological responses (1–3).
A well studied signaling pathway is the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which underlies the regulation
of many cellular processes (4). The basic signaling unit of this
enzymatic cascade is a three-kinase module allowing the transmission of an extracellular cue to specific target proteins by
sequential phosphorylation events: A MAPK kinase kinase
activates a MAPK kinase, which in turn activates a MAPK that
finally is capable of activating multiple target proteins. Interestingly, activation of a particular MAPK yields different biological
outputs. Therefore the individual MAPK pathways have acquired sophisticated regulatory mechanisms that mainly depend
on certain scaffold and adaptor proteins (2, 5, 6).

The prototype of a scaffold protein is the protein Ste5, which
is critical for the mating pheromone response in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. Ste5 binds all three members of the Ste11–Ste7–Fus3
MAPK cascade, thereby facilitating signal transmission within
the three-kinase module. Additionally, it positions the Ste11–
Ste7–Fus3 complex in close proximity to the plasma membrane,
allowing activation by membrane-associated upstream regulators (7, 8). Although the general setup of the MAPK cascade is
well conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution, no Ste5p is
present in higher eukaryotes.
Higher eukaryotes use different scaffolding complexes. Kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), connector enhancer of KSR
(CNK), and MAPK兾ERK kinase 1 (MEK1) partner (MP1) are
known to regulate and specify signal transduction within the
extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) cascade (9, 10). The ERK
cascade is one of the four different MAPK pathways in higher
eukaryotes (4) and is critically involved in the regulation of cell
proliferation, differentiation, and survival, depending on the
extracellular stimuli (6). Its three-kinase module is formed by
Raf, MEK, and ERK. The existence of three Raf (Raf-1, B-Raf,
and A-Raf), two MEK (MEK1 and MEK2), and two ERK
(ERK1 and ERK2) isoforms introduces additional complexity in
mammalian cells. KSR proteins combine the properties of
scaffolding and adaptor proteins. They regulate the assembly and
activation of the Ras–MEK–ERK module upon Ras activation at
the plasma membrane. In addition, KSR interacts with several
regulatory proteins that control membrane attachment of the
KSR–MAPK signaling complex (11–13). The MP1 scaffold was
initially identified by its capability to bind to the proline-rich
region of MEK1 and to activate ERK1 but not ERK2 signaling.
Thus it was proposed that MP1 facilitates ERK signaling by
specifically mediating MEK1–ERK1 interactions (14).
The existence of adaptor proteins that determine the localization of scaffold proteins provides additional flexibility in
regulating the efficiency and the specificity of the MAPK
cascade (5). As shown by Teis et al. (16), p14 functions as an
endosomal adaptor for MP1. p14 is required to attach MP1 to
late endosomes, since depletion of p14 resulted in mislocalization of MP1 to the cytoplasm and in defective ERK signaling (15,
16). Interestingly, only endosomal ERK activation was affected
by short interfering RNA of either p14 or MP1 (16). In contrast,

Cloning, Expression, and Protein Purification. For bicistronic protein

expression, the DNA sequences encoding murine p14 and MP1
were amplified by PCR and subcloned separately into pET28
(Novagen) with MP1 being expressed as a C-terminal His-tag
protein. The MP1 construct was subcloned together with its
ribosomal-binding site into the pET28 vector expressing p14.
The resulting bicistronic plasmid pET-p14MP1 allowed coexpression of p14 and MP1 in rather equal amounts. The plasmid
pET-p14MP1 was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain
BL21(DE3). Cells were grown at 37°C in LB medium and
induced at OD600 ⫽ 0.6 by adding 1 mM isopropyl ␤-Dthiogalactoside. Protein induction was prolonged overnight at
37°C. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mM sodium兾potassium phosphate (pH 7.5)兾300
mM NaCl, and lysed by freeze–thawing and subsequent sonification on ice. The protein complex was purified by affinity
chromatography using the nickel nitrilotriacetate resin from
Qiagen. A Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences) was instrumental for further polishing and to adjust the
protein buffer to 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5)兾150 mM NaCl兾2 mM
2-mercaptoethanol. Before crystallization, p14兾MP1 was concentrated by ultrafiltration to 7 mg兾ml by using Centripreps
(YM-3, Amicon).
The p14⌬b3 and the p14b3* mutants were generated by using a
PCR mutagenesis protocol. The blunt-end PCR products where
subcloned into the pCR-blunt vector from Invitrogen. Generation
of the Xpress-tagged mutants of p14 and MP1 proceeded as for
the respective WT cDNA (15, 16). Cells were transfected with
the different constructs by using the Lipofectamine Plus system
(Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s suggestions.
Crystallization and Structure Solution. Crystallization was carried
out at 19°C by using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. The
keys for obtaining well diffracting crystals were the use of
selenomethionine-substituted protein and the nanoliter setup of
crystallization trials. Crystals of p14兾MP1 were grown in sitting
drops at 19°C by mixing 200 nl of protein with 100 nl of a
crystallization solution containing 25% (wt兾vol) polyethylene
glycol 4000, 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.5), and 0.2 M MgCl2. Crystal trials
were setup in Greiner plates with a reservoir volume of 100 ␮l.
Orthorhombic crystals appeared overnight with dimensions of
50 ⫻ 50 ⫻ 200 ␮m3. For cryo measurements, crystals were
transferred from the crystallization drop to the mother liquor
supplied with 15% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol as cryoprotectant
and rapidly frozen in a 100-K stream of nitrogen gas. All crystals
belonged to space group P212121 with cell constants a ⫽ 50.1 Å,
b ⫽ 62.5 Å, and c ⫽ 73.0 Å, corresponding to a solvent content
of 33% for one p14兾MP1 heterodimer in the asymmetric unit.
Single anomalous diffraction data of the selenomethionine
derivative were collected at the Deutsches ElektronenSynchrotron, Hamburg (beamline BW6). The diffraction data
were processed and scaled with the programs DENZO and
Kurzbauer et al.

(18). Subsequently, difference Fourier analyses performed with SHELX enabled us to identify four of the six
theoretical selenium sites. Refinement of heavy atom parameters and phase calculation were done with SHARP (19) and
solvent flattening was with SOLOMON (20). Energy-restrained
crystallographic refinement was carried out with maximum
likelihood algorithms implemented in CNS (21), using the protein
parameters of Engh and Huber (22). Refinement, model rebuilding with the program O (23), and water incorporation
proceeded smoothly by means of rigid body, positional, and later
B-factor optimization. The entire structure was checked by using
simulated annealing composite omit maps. Some terminal protein segments were hardly visible in these maps and were
therefore omitted from the model. After the addition of solvent
molecules, the refinement converged at an R factor of 21.3%
(Rfree ⫽ 25.9%). The data collection, phasing, and refinement
statistics are summarized in Table 1, which is published as
supporting information on the PNAS web site. All graphical
presentations were prepared by using the programs MOLSCRIPT
(24), RASTER3D (25), and DINO (www.dino3d.org). Molecular
surfaces and electrostatic potential were calculated by using
MSMS (26) and MEAD (27), respectively.
SCALEPACK

Coimmunoprecipitation, Pulldown Experiments, and Immunofluorescence. Experiments where performed as described in previous

studies by using the corresponding antibodies (15, 16).

Phosphorylation Reaction. HeLa cells were serum starved overnight and stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 10
min. A total cell lysate was generated as described (16). The
phosphorylation reaction contained 40 ␮l of cell lysate from
EGF-stimulated HeLa cells and 0, 20, 100, 500, and 2,000 pg of
purified p14兾MP1 complex, kinase reaction buffer (50 mM
Hepes, pH 7.4兾10 mM MgCl2兾1 mM DTT), and 5 ␮M ATP in
a final volume of 60 ␮l, which was incubated for 30 min at 30°C.
The total reaction was subjected to SDS兾PAGE and probed with
the indicated antibodies.
Endosome Purification from BHK Cells. BHK (baby hamster kidney)

cells were washed three times with PBS. Cells were pelleted at
200 ⫻ g for 5 min. The cell pellet was rebuffered in HB buffer
(250 mM sucrose兾3 mM imidazole, pH 7.4兾1 mM EDTA兾
protease inhibitors) and again pelleted at 2,500 rpm for 10 min.
The cell pellet was resuspended in HB buffer and homogenized
by four passes through a 22-gauge needle. Postnuclear supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 15 min at
4°C. The postnuclear supernatant was diluted 1:1.2 in 62%
sucrose, loaded on the bottom of a Beckman SW41 tube, and
overlaid with 4 ml of 35% sucrose and 3 ml of 25% sucrose. Early
and late endosomal fractions were obtained in different fractions
by centrifugation at 100,000 ⫻ g for 3 h at 4°C.
Biosensor Measurements. To determine quantitatively the inter-

actions between the purified p14 protein (purified from E. coli
as GST-fused protein) and MP1 (purified from Sf9 insect cells
as His-tagged protein), the surface plasmon resonance technique
was applied. All biosensor measurements were carried out on a
BIAcore-X system (Biacore, Uppsala) at 25°C. For that purpose,
the biosensor chip CM5 was first loaded with anti-GST antibody
by using covalent derivatization. Purified GST-tagged p14 was
injected in biosensor buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4兾150 mM
NaCl兾0.01% Nonidet P-40) at a flow rate of 10 ␮l兾min, resulting
in a deposition of ⬇600–650 response units. Next the purified
MP1 was injected at increasing concentrations (10–250 nM) at
a flow rate of 10 ␮l兾min. The values for unspecific binding
measured in the reference cell were subtracted. The evaluation
of the kinetic parameters for MP1 binding to p14 was performed
by nonlinear fitting of binding data by using the BIAEVALUATION

the p14兾MP1 complex appears dispensable for the initial phase
of MAPK signaling at the plasma membrane, which requires
KSR (12). These findings raise the intriguing possibility that
KSR assembles a signaling complex at the plasma membrane and
generates an ERK signal that is different from a p14兾MP1coordinated ERK signal emanating from endosomes (17). However, the molecular mechanisms of compartmentalized ERK
signaling remain to be elucidated.
Here, we show in atomic detail how p14 and MP1 form an
adaptor兾scaffold complex and how this complex is tethered to
late endosomes. Using specific mutations, we identified the
endosomal adaptor motif of p14, which determines the relative
orientation of the p14兾MP1 heterodimer relative to the endosomal membrane.

Results and Discussion
Biochemical Characterization of the Recombinant p14兾MP1 Complex.

Separate expression and purification of full-length MP1 or p14
in E. coli yielded low protein amounts, which were rather
insoluble (solubility ⬍1 mg兾ml). Coexpressing the two proteins
with a bicistronic vector enabled us to purify the physiological
complex in large quantities and in high concentration (⬎15
mg兾ml). His-tagging one of the two components allowed for
isolating the p14兾MP1 complex by Ni-affinity chromatography.
Further polishing was achieved by gel filtration chromatography.
Homogeneity and 1:1 stoichiometry were validated by SDS兾
PAGE (Fig. 1A) and MS (data not shown). The real-time
stability of the p14兾MP1 complex was investigated by using the
Biacore technique. GST-p14 was immobilized on the CM5 chip
coated with anti-GST antibody. Purified MP1 was injected in the
concentration range of 10–250 nM (Fig. 1B). The apparent
association rate constant for MP1 binding to GST-p14 was
4.68 ⫻ 104 M⫺1䡠s⫺1, and the dissociation rate constant was 5.97 ⫻
10⫺4 s⫺1, thus leading to a Kd of 12.8 nM that reflects the
high-affinity association of p14 and MP1.
We have previously shown that p14 and MP1 are required for
MAPK signaling and synergize to enhance ERK1兾2 activation
(16). Therefore we next tested whether the purified p14兾MP1
would enhance ERK1兾2 activation in a cell lysate. The addition
of increasing concentrations of the p14兾MP1 complex resulted
in enhanced activation of ERK1兾2 in a cell lysate from EGFstimulated HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). Another essential feature of
p14兾MP1 for biological function is its endosomal localization
(15, 16). Therefore we next investigated whether the recombi10986 兩 www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0403435101

nant p14兾MP1 complex would bind to cell membranes in vitro
(Fig. 1D). The p14兾MP1 complex and GST, which we used as a
control having a similar size and molecular weight, were incubated with buffer alone, cytoplasm, and total cell membranes. A
high-speed centrifugation at 100,000 ⫻ g was used to pellet
membranes and membrane-bound proteins. GST was always
found in the supernatant regardless of whether it was incubated
with buffer, cytosol, or membranes. Incubation of p14兾MP1 with
buffer alone or cytoplasm did not result in copelleting, whereas
incubation of p14兾MP1 with total cell membranes resulted in
efficient copelleting with membranes. To confirm the specificity
of membrane binding, we used purified endosomes (15) instead
of total cell membranes. The p14兾MP1 complex did copellet
efficiently with endosomes, whereas GST was recovered only in
the supernatant after 100,000 ⫻ g centrifugation. Moreover
copelleting of the p14兾MP1 complex with endosomes was dependent on the amount of endosomes present in the binding
assay. Taken together, p14 and MP1 form a tight complex that
is capable of enhancing ERK1兾2 activation in a cell lysate and
binding to endosomal membranes. These results show that the
isolated recombinant p14兾MP1 complex mirrors the properties
of the complex in vivo and should allow reconstruction of the
biologically relevant structure.
Structure of p14 and MP1. Crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction

were obtained by the vapor diffusion method but only with
nanoliter setups. The brick-shaped crystals belonged to space
group P212121, having unit cell constants of a ⫽ 50.1 Å, b ⫽ 62.5
Å, and c ⫽ 73.0 Å. A selenomethionine-substituted p14兾MP1
complex was purified and crystallized, and the structure was
determined by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. The
experimental electron density map was of excellent quality (Fig.
2A) and enabled us to build the entire model with the exception
of a few terminal residues. The model was refined to a crystallographic R factor of 21.3% and a free R factor of 25.9% at 1.9-Å
resolution and exhibited good stereochemistry (see Table 1).
The p14 protein folds as a compact domain and consists of a
central five-stranded antiparallel ␤-sheet sandwiched by ␣-helix
b on one side and the terminal helices a and c on the other side
(Fig. 2B). The electron density for the loop connecting ␣b and
␤3 was not well defined, and this b3 loop (loop nomenclature
according to connected secondary structure elements) should be
considered as very flexible. Furthermore, the seven C-terminal
residues of p14 could not be traced in the electron density map.
MP1 obtains a homologous fold built around a central fivestranded ␤-sheet with the same strand order 2 1 5 4 3. The
terminal helices a and c flank one side of the sheet, whereas the
␣-helices b and b2, which together equal the p14 helix b, and the
310-helix b1 shield the other side of the ␤-sheet. The entire MP1
structure was well defined by electron density with the exception
of seven C-terminal residues. Several potential protein-binding
pockets can be distinguished in both proteins. Two pockets are
located on either side of helix b (Fig. 2C). The 2b pocket is lined
by the N terminus of helix b, loops 2b and 34, whereas the b3
pocket is organized around the central part of helix b, loops 12
and 45. A third pocket, the ac pocket, is formed by the terminal
helices a and c.
Both proteins adopt a strikingly homologous domain structure, with very similar shape, dimensions, and relative orientations of secondary structure elements (Fig. 2C). The least-square
superposition aligns 95 C␣ atoms with rms deviations of 1.82 Å.
The first region of divergence comprises the N and C termini. In
MP1, the C-terminal extension of helix c is folded as a helical
segment that further runs across and reaches over the edge of the
curved ␤-sheet. In p14 the corresponding segment points away
from the protein body, protruding into the surroundings. Furthermore, the N terminus of p14 approaches its C terminus,
thereby extending with Met-1 and Leu-2 the hydrophobic surKurzbauer et al.

face of the ac pocket, a feature that is absent from MP1. Loop
b3 represents the second divergent region, which is composed of
residues 57–70 in p14 and 59–68 in MP1. In both cases this loop
is not attached by any interaction to the body of the protein and
thus appears to be rather flexible. It protrudes into the protein
periphery but with different orientations. The third region of
divergence is also situated on the helix b layer side and is
composed of the N terminus of helix b and its preceding loop 2b.
In p14, a wide hydrophobic 2b pocket can be observed that is
partially blocked in MP1 by helix b1 and a differently folded loop
2b. Furthermore, in MP1 the remainder of the corresponding 2b
pocket is filled by several bulky residues such as His-43, Phe-49,
Tyr-75, and Tyr-78, which have smaller counterparts in p14.
The p14兾MP1 Complex Is an Almost Symmetrical Twin Couple. In the
p14兾MP1 complex, the domains reveal an extensive interactions
surface, allowing for high-affinity binding. As shown in Fig. 2D,
the complex exhibits a striking symmetric appearance that has no
structural homolog in the Protein Data Bank. p14 and MP1

The Surface Properties of MP1兾p14 Point to Several Potential ProteinBinding Sites. To identify potential sites for interactions with

other molecules, we analyzed the crystal contacts, the electrostatic properties, and the conservation pattern of the p14兾MP1
heterodimer (Fig. 3). Both p14 and MP1 have many solventexposed apolar residues that constitute distinctive hydrophobic
pockets on the two- and the four-helix sides of the heterodimer.
On the four-helix side, only one hydrophobic pocket can be
observed, which corresponds to the p14 ac pocket, i.e., at the
interface of helices a and c. Residues that line this hydrophobic
pocket are highly conserved in the p14 family, and thus the p14
ac pocket should be considered as potential protein-binding
pocket. Consistently, this pocket is also involved in establishing
crystal contacts, binding a phenylalanine residue of a molecular
neighbor (see Fig. 5B). A second remarkable feature of the
four-helix side is a strikingly electropositive channel that penetrates the entire heterodimer at the p14兾MP1 midline. Some of
the residues that are mainly responsible for the basic rendering
of this channel are strictly conserved, whereas for other residues
conservative exchanges are allowed, which will not change the
overall electrostatic surface potential. Thus, the electropositive

associate to form a continuous, antiparallel 10-stranded ␤-sheet
with strand order 2 1 5 4 3 3* 4* 5* 1* 2* (the asterisk denotes
MP1). The inner pair of ␤-strands, i.e., 3 and 3*, interact with
each other by nine main-chain hydrogen bonds. One side of the
central ␤-sheet is covered by two two-helix bundles, ac and a*c*
(the four-helix side), whereas the other side is covered by the bb*
two-helix bundle (the two-helix side). The b helices are coupled
to each other by a zipper-like arrangement of several intertwining hydrophobic residues, including Ala-59, Tyr-56, Ile-52, Ile48, Phe-49*, Thr-52*, Phe-53*, Ala-56*, Gln-59* (aliphatic part),
and Leu-63*. This hydrophobic cluster is extended by several
residues of ␤-strands 3 and 3*, including Leu-69, Ile-72, Met-74,
Cys-76, Ile-71*, Cys-73*, and Tyr-75*, thereby forming a prominent hydrophobic core in the center of the heterodimer with
almost equal contributions from p14 and MP1. Furthermore,
loop b3* of MP1 fits precisely in the complementary-shaped 2b
pocket of p14. Here, the two MP1 leucines, Leu-63* and
Leu-65*, interact with the p14 residues Ile-48, Ile-52, Met-74,
Val-81, Ile-83, and Tyr-94 in a lock-and-key fashion. The other
face of the ␤-sheet, the four-helix side, is rather polar. On this
side, heterodimer stabilization is achieved by several hydrogen
bonds and salt bridges formed between Asp-75–Lys-69*, Lys70–Asn-76*, Asp-67–Thr-77*, and Glu-78–Ser-66*. The latter
two interactions seem to seal both sides of the mixed ␤-sheet 33*.
In the center of the four-helix side, a deep polar canyon
penetrates the entire heterodimer, running along ␤-strand 3* of
MP1. The walls of this midline canyon are lined with several basic
residues (Arg-80, Lys-105, Lys-70, Lys-69*, Arg-85*, and Lys108*) and several residues with H-donor groups (Gln-109,
Asn-76*, Ser-70*, Tyr-74*, Gln-79*, Thr-100*, and Ser-105*).
Using 100 mM phosphate as crystallization additive, we
obtained a second crystal form that provided some interesting
features. Here, the flexible b3 loop of p14 was clearly defined by
electron density and was rather rigid as indicated by its average

Most interestingly, loop b3 obtains a different conformation than
in the previously determined structure. It is bent toward MP1
and is in van der Waals contact with a few residues of the MP1
2b* pocket. Furthermore, one of its side chains, Phe-64, protrudes outwards into the hydrophobic ac pocket of a neighboring
p14 molecule, where it undergoes ring-stacking interactions with
Tyr-114 (see Fig. 5B). The ability to attain different conformations and to establish crystal contacts by means of a solventexposed hydrophobic residue highlights the potential of the p14
loop b3 to mediate protein–protein interactions.

tion, the respective b3 pockets are poised for binding partner
proteins (Fig. 2D).

Mutational Analysis of p14. The structural analysis of the p14兾MP1
complex implicates an important role for the b3 loops of p14 and
MP1 in defining the respective interaction partners. We therefore investigated the function of this loop by generating specific
mutations in p14. The loop b3 was either deleted (p14⌬b3: p14
amino acid residues 57–70 were replaced with Gly-Ala) or
exchanged with the corresponding b3* loop from MP1 (p14b3*:
p14 amino acid residues 57–70 replaced with MP1 amino acid
residues 59–68). To study the effects of these mutations, Xpresstagged p14 (Xp14) mutants were coexpressed with myc-tagged
MP1 (MP1-myc) in HeLa cells (Fig. 4).
Immunofluorescence and confocal image analysis were used
to determine the subcellular location of the p14 mutants. Xp14
did colocalize with MP1-myc in 81% of all cells on late endo-

channel seems to be a common feature of p14兾MP1 complexes
and could be of functional importance. It is also notable that
MP1 exhibits a rather weak conservation pattern on the fourhelix side, suggesting that this face of MP1 plays only a minor role
in binding to target proteins.
In contrast, MP1 has a potential protein interaction patch on
the two-helix side. Several highly conserved apolar residues are
clustered around the invariant DG motif setting up the b3*
pocket. The hydrophobic part of this pocket is constructed by
Val-30*, Pro-31*, Val-32*, Val-120*, and Val-121*. In both
crystal forms, this part is occupied by the side chain of Tyr-37
that originates from a symmetry-related p14 molecule (Fig. 5B).
Furthermore the OH function of this tyrosine interacts with the
carboxylate group of Asp-26, which is held in place by the highly
invariant DG motif of MP1. On the two-helix side, an additional
prominent hydrophobic pocket is situated beneath loop l2 of p14.
This loop approaches and runs along helix b because of a special
backbone conformation of its DG motif (Glu-28–Gly-29). The
close helix-loop packing is stabilized by several van der Waals
interactions and leads to the opening up of the hydrophobic core
of p14. As a consequence, residues Met-1, Leu-2, Leu-7, Leu-11,
Leu-24, Leu-32, Val-86, Leu-89, Pro-112, and Leu-115 form a
huge hydrophobic b3 pocket, with several apolar residues being
completely exposed to the solvent. Most of these residues
constitute the most highly conserved stretch of amino acids in
p14. Thus the b3 pocket of p14 might represent a protein-binding
surface. Remarkably, sequence and structural comparisons further demonstrate the importance of the 2b and b3 pockets for
mediating protein–protein interactions (for details, see Supporting Results and Discussion and Fig. 6, which are published as
supporting information on the PNAS web site). Whereas the 2b
pockets of p14 and MP1 are exploited for heterodimer forma10988 兩 www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0403435101

Fig. 4. Mutations affecting the b3 loop of p14 alter the subcellular distribution of p14兾MP1. (A) Xpress-tagged WT p14, p14⌬b3, and p14b3* proteins
were coexpressed with MP1-myc. Subsequently, cells were subjected to indirect immunofluorescence analysis using anti-Xpress and anti-myc antibodies.
Xp14 (red) and MP1-myc (green) colocalize on late endosomes (yellow).
Xp14⌬b3 was localized in the cytoplasm and did not colocalize with MP1 on
late endosomes. Xp14b3* was found to colocalize with MP1-myc on late
endosomes but also partially in the cytoplasm. (B) Xp14, Xp14⌬b3, and
Xp14b3* were coexpressed with MP1-myc or myc-tagged p14. The Xpresstagged proteins were immunoprecipitated (IP) with an anti-Xpress antibody.
To demonstrate equal MP1-myc or myc-p14 expression, cell lysates were
probed with anti-myc antibodies (Input). Probing p14 immunoprecipitates
with anti-myc (MP1 and p14) antibodies detected interaction of Xp14 with
MP1-myc (lane 1) and of Xp14b3* with myc-p14 (lane 6).

p14兾MP1 Acting as a MAPK-Scaffolding Complex Anchored to Late
Endosomes. The endosomal localization of the p14兾MP1-

MAPK scaffold complex is essential for efficient signaling in
the ERK cascade upon EGF simulation. Whereas MP1 acts as
the corresponding scaffold protein, p14 functions as an adaptor localizing the MP1–MAPK module to endosomes (16). The
present structural and biochemical data allow the proposal of
a model: How p14 and MP1 collaborate in endosomal MAPK
signal transduction.
Regardless of its small size, several potential protein-binding
sites are located on the p14 adaptor protein. Mutational analysis
demonstrated the importance of its b3 loop acting as endosomal

adaptor motif. It appears likely that this loop targets the complex
to late endosomes by specific interaction with a so far unknown
target protein. Further work is needed to identify such a partner.
Interestingly, the ac pocket of p14 and the positively charged
midline canyon are located on the same side of the heterodimer
as loop b3. Thus it is tempting to speculate that the latter two
features contribute to defining the localization of the p14兾MP1
complex relative to the endosomal membrane. We believe that
the four-helix side of heterodimer will face the endosomal
membrane, thereby providing access for cytoplasmic partners to
the two-helix side of the heterodimer. Especially the conservation pattern of surface-exposed MP1 residues supports this idea.
Whereas the four-helix side exhibits a rather weak degree of
conservation, the two-helix side is much more conserved. Here,
a potential protein-binding site is organized around the highly
conserved DG motif. The corresponding surface patch is characterized by a highly electronegative region enclosed by hydrophobic residues. Remarkably, all MAPKs use a negatively
charged region, the so-called conserved docking domain (sequence of the ERK2 motif: LEQYYDPTDEPVA) to interact
with substrates, regulators, and activators. It has been shown that
activators of MAPKs such as MEK1兾2 bind to the conserved
docking domain by a positively charged region, the so-called
docking site (sequence of MEK1: MPKKKPTPIQLNPNP) (28).
We propose that the acidic patch clustered around the highly
conserved DG motif of MP1 might be used to establish a similar
interaction to MEK1. Interestingly, the prominent b3 pocket of
p14 is located on the same side of the heterodimer and might
thus function as binding site for a second protein (Fig. 2D). The
two p14- and MP1-binding sites could act in concert to facilitate
the interaction between MEK1 and ERK1. Consistently, biochemical data indicate a synergistic mode of action for mediating
p14兾MP1-dependent MAPK signaling (16). More studies are
necessary to investigate this model. The present structure will be
instrumental to construct site-specific mutants that might interfere with p14兾MP1 dimerization and兾or binding to the MAPK
partner proteins MEK1 and ERK1.

somes (n ⫽ 100). Only in cells that strongly overexpress both
Xp14 and MP1-myc were the two proteins found in the cytoplasm. Remarkably, the Xp14⌬b3 was never found to colocalize
with MP1-myc on late endosomes and was always observed in the
cytoplasm (n ⫽ 100). Obviously, loop b3 is required to define the
endosomal localization of p14. However, in 28% of all p14⌬b3expressing cells (n ⫽ 100), the mutated protein was found in
subcellular protein aggregates that did not colocalize with
MP1-myc. Moreover, it was not possible to express Xp14⌬b3 in
amounts equal to Xp14 or Xp14b3* protein levels (Fig. 4B).
These results indicate that cells do not tolerate high levels of the
cytoplasmic, mislocalized Xp14⌬b3 protein.
Surprisingly, the Xp14b3* mutant showed endosomal localization in 64% (n ⫽ 100) of all Xp14b3*-positive cells. According
to the p14兾MP1 crystal structure, loop b3 of MP1 is essential to
interact with p14. Thus the Xp14b3* mutant could have acquired
the capability to interact with endogenous p14, forming an
Xp14b3*兾p14 pseudohomodimer. To test this prediction, the
interactions of Xp14, Xp14⌬b3, and Xp14b3* with MP1-myc or
p14-myc were investigated by using co-immunoprecipitation
experiments. MP1-myc was co-immunoprecipitated only in the
presence of Xp14 (Fig. 4, lane 1), whereas Xp14⌬b3 and the
Xp14b3* mutants showed no significant interactions with MP1
(lanes 2 and 3). Interestingly, p14-myc was co-immunoprecipitated only by the Xp14b3* (lane 6) mutant and not by Xp14 (lane
4) or Xp14⌬b3 (lane 5). These findings confirm that the p14b3*
mutant is indeed able to form a p14b3*兾p14 dimer, demonstrating the important role of the MP1 loop b3 to establish and
stabilize the interaction with p14. Taking the results together, the
mutational analysis demonstrates that the b3 loop of p14 is
required to target p14 to late endosomes and that the b3* loop
of MP1 defines the interaction of MP1 with p14.
