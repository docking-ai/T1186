Class D β-lactamases with carbapenemase activity are emerging as
carbapenem-resistance determinants in Gram-negative bacterial
pathogens, mostly Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Carbapenemase activity is an unusual feature among class
D β-lactamases, and the structural elements responsible for this activity remain unclear. Based on structural and molecular dynamics
data, we previously hypothesized a potential role of the residues
located in the short-loop connecting strands β5 and β6 (the β5–β6
loop) in conferring the carbapenemase activity of the OXA-48 enzyme. In this work, the narrow-spectrum OXA-10 class D β-lactamase, which is unable to hydrolyze carbapenems, was used as a
model to investigate the possibility of evolving carbapenemase activity by replacement of the β5–β6 loop with those present in three
different lineages of class D carbapenemases (OXA-23, OXA-24, and
OXA-48). Biological assays and kinetic measurements showed that
all three OXA-10–derived hybrids acquired signiﬁcant carbapenemase activity. Structural analysis of the OXA-10loop24 and OXA10loop48 hybrids revealed no signiﬁcant changes in the molecular
fold of the enzyme, except for the orientation of the substituted
β5–β6 loops, which was reminiscent of that found in their parental
enzymes. These results demonstrate the crucial role of the β5–β6
loop in the carbapenemase activity of class D β-lactamases, and provide previously unexplored insights into the mechanism by which
these enzymes can evolve carbapenemase activity.

lthough antimicrobial chemotherapy represented one of the
major advances of medicine in the last century, the efﬁcacy
of antibiotics has been relentlessly challenged by the emergence
of resistant bacteria. Because of their efﬁcacy and safety, β-lactams, still represent the most widely used antibiotics (1). Among
these β-lactams, carbapenems currently have a critical importance as they are active against a wide range of Gram-negative
pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains, and are increasingly used to treat severe infections acquired in the hospital
setting. Thus, the worldwide emergence of carbapenem-resistant
bacteria, commonly associated with either multidrug resistance
or extensively-drug resistant phenotypes, is considered one of the
major challenges for the treatment of bacterial infections (2, 3).
β-Lactamases (which hydrolyze the amide bond of the β-lactam
ring) play a key role in the development of acquired resistance to
β-lactams in many bacterial pathogens. Two structurally and
mechanistically unrelated families of β-lactamases are known: (i)
the most numerous active serine enzymes (belonging to the molecular classes A, C, and D) that hydrolyze their substrates via the
formation of an acyl-enzyme covalent complex, and (ii) the zincdependent metallo-β-lactamases (class B). Serine-β-lactamases,
besides having an impressive sequence heterogeneity, share common catalytically important residues: the S*xxV motif (motif 1, S*
being the catalytic serine), SxV (motif 2), and K-T/S-G motif
(motif 3) (4).

The production of β-lactamases capable of hydrolyzing carbapenems (carbapenemases) is one of the major mechanisms of
carbapenem resistance. Known carbapenemases include enzymes
of molecular classes A, B, and D, each showing distinct structural
and biochemical properties but with the common ability to inactivate carbapenem antibiotics (4).
The class D (OXA-type) carbapenemases play a major role in
acquired carbapenem resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii and,
to a lesser extent, in Klebsiella pneumoniae (5). Four major lineages
of acquired class D carbapenemases are known—namely OXA-23,
OXA-24, OXA-48, and OXA-58 (some including closely related
allelic variants)—that are notably different from each other at
the level of primary structure (34–63% amino acid sequence
divergence).
As a result of recently obtained X-ray structural data, some
attempts have been made to unravel the structure–function relationships of these clinically relevant enzymes (6, 7). The 3D
structure of OXA-24 shows an unusual tunnel-like entrance of the
active site, stabilized by the interaction between tyrosine 112 and
methionine 223, which was retained as critical for the carbapenemase activity of this enzyme and was proposed to be the main
factor to dictate the biochemical properties of OXA-24. The
tunnel-like entrance of OXA-24 was also hypothesized to be essential for the correct orientation of carbapenem substrates and,
therefore, their entrance in the active site (6). Although this study
did provide a structural basis for the unusual substrate proﬁle of
OXA-24 (i.e., the lack of hydrolysis of oxacillin substrates with
bulkier side chains because of steric hindrance, with the residues
constituting the tunnel-like active site entrance), it did not provide
a general mechanism for carbapenem hydrolysis by class D carbapenemases. More recently, the structure of OXA-48 was
obtained, which surprisingly does not show the same tunnel-like
entrance. Despite this lack of a tunnel-like entrance, the enzyme is
currently (in terms of turnover rates) the most efﬁcient class D
carbapenemase (kcat for imipenem, 5 s−1, a value still rather low
compared with that of the best substrates of OXA-type enzymes;
that is, the steady-state kcat value for cloxacillin or oxacillin can be
as high as 500–600 s−1) (8). Moreover, structural analysis, molecular dynamics, and molecular modeling studies pointed to the
potential role of the residues located in the β5–β6 loop. Indeed,
we previously proposed a mechanism for carbapenem hydrolysis
that involves an enzyme-assisted rotation of hydroxyethyl moiety
of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, a process in which the residues

of the β5–β6 loop would be directly involved and which would
allow the deacylation water molecule to reach the scissile bond
and perform the nucleophilic attack, leading to the breakdown of
the acyl-enzyme complex (7).
To provide experimental evidence for the suggested role of the
β5–β6 loop in carbapenemase activity of class D enzymes, we
substituted the β5–β6 loop of the noncarbapenemase enzyme
OXA-10 with the structurally-equivalent loops of three class D
carbapenemases (OXA-23, OXA-24, and OXA-48), and tested
the β-lactamase proﬁle of the hybrid proteins and their functional
and structural features. Indeed, the hybrid OXA-10 proteins acted

as functional carbapenemases, thus demonstrating the crucial role
of the β5–β6 loop in the evolution of carbapenemase activity and
modulation of substrate speciﬁcity among class D β-lactamases.
Results and Discussion
Structural Variability of the β5–β6 Loop in Class D Carbapenemases
vs. Noncarbapenemases. A thorough comparison of the structures

of class D carbapenemases OXA-24 and OXA-48 with that of class
D noncarbapenemase OXA-10 was done. Interestingly, a major
difference was observed in the orientation and size of the β5–β6
loop, which appeared to be similar in OXA-24 and OXA-48 but
different from that of OXA-10 (Fig. 1) and other class D β-lactamases whose structure has been obtained (9–13). This loop is
close to the active site and connects two β-strands, one of which
includes the catalytically relevant conserved K205TG residues (a
conserved motif of serine β-lactamases, which delimits one side
of the active site) (Fig. 1). The same loop also delimits one side of
the active site in the carbapenemases OXA-24 and OXA-48, although it points outwards to the active site in OXA-10 (Fig. 1A).
This structural heterogeneity could further support our previous
hypothesis regarding the relevance of the residues in the β5–β6
loop in the enzyme catalytic properties, and more speciﬁcally in
determining the fate of the acyl-enzyme complex in the case of
carbapenems (i.e., inhibition or efﬁcient hydrolysis) (7).

of the β5–β6 loop in the carbapenemase activity of class D carbapenemases was probed by mutagenesis, and OXA-10 was used
as a protein model to evaluate the possibility to evolve carbapenemase activity in an enzyme lacking this property. OXA-10 variants differing in the nature of the residues located in the β5–β6
loop were designed using a structure-based rational approach in
which the β5–β6 loop of OXA-10 was replaced with the corresponding structural element of class D carbapenemases OXA-24
and OXA-48 (Fig. 1B).
On the basis of sequence homology, and despite the fact that 3D
structural data are not available for this enzyme, the same strategy
was used to obtain an OXA-10 derivative carrying the β5–β6 loop of
OXA-23, a class D carbapenemase closer to OXA-24 than OXA48 (OXA-23 exhibits 59% and 35% identity with these enzymes,
respectively). Interestingly, OXA-23 shows 4 amino acid substitutions in its β5–β6 loop compared with OXA-24 (Fig. 1B), and
thus was used as a further probe for the impact of structure diversity
in this element on the functional properties of the enzymes.
These OXA-10 laboratory variants were then cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α to investigate their potential
contribution to β-lactam resistance and investigate their biochemical and structural properties. The authenticity of the puriﬁed OXA-10 derivatives has been assessed by sequencing of the
plasmid constructs and by peptide mass ﬁngerprint MALDI-TOF

carbapenemases was probed by mutagenesis. The β5–β6 loop of these class D
carbapenemases was grafted in the structurally equivalent position of the
narrow-spectrum class D enzyme OXA-10, to obtain three OXA-10 loop variants named OXA-10loop23, OXA-10loop24, and OXA-10loop48, as shown.

β5–β6 Loop Variants of OXA-10 Exhibit Carbapenem-Hydrolyzing
Activity. The contribution of OXA-10 loop variants to resistance

to β-lactam antibiotics in an E. coli DH5α laboratory strain was
investigated by measuring the minimal inhibitory concentrations
(MICs) for several antibiotics (Table 1). The strains producing the
enzyme variants exhibited high MIC values for penicillins, although
somewhat lower than those of the strain producing the wild-type
enzyme. These data indicate that the substitution of the β5–β6 loop
in OXA-10 yields a functional enzyme, which can efﬁciently confer
β-lactam resistance in vitro. The MIC values of carbapenems for
the various strains were rather low for all mutants. However, it was
already observed that the contribution of carbapenem-hydrolyzing
enzymes in regards to the resistance to carbapenems in E. coli was
very limited, and the fast permeation of carbapenems in this microorganism was demonstrated to be determinant in the resulting
antibacterial activity of these compounds (14).
A more sensitive method was then devised to quickly obtain
relevant information regarding the impact of the various substitutions on the OXA-10 catalytic properties, especially regarding
carbapenems. The carbapenemase plate assay (see Materials and
Methods for details) was based on the microbial titration of imipenem after incubation with crude extracts of the E. coli strains
producing the wild-type OXA-10 and the various OXA-10 variants
(a β-lactamase–negative strain was used as the negative control),
using Bacillus subtilis as the indicator organism. This method
yielded interesting results, as it clearly highlighted different

behaviors between the wild-type OXA-10 and the loop variants
(Table 2 and Fig. S1). Indeed, wild-type OXA-10 expectedly
proved unable to signiﬁcantly degrade imipenem after 4 h of incubation, as shown by the constant growth inhibition of B. subtilis.
In contrast, all loop variants showed a complete degradation of the
antibiotic within 2 to 3 h by the physiological amount of β-lactamase produced by the respective E. coli clones, as shown by the
absence of growth inhibition of the indicator organism.
These data indicated that the loop variants deﬁnitely acquired
carbapenem-hydrolyzing activity. Interestingly, the same result was
achieved independently of the nature and origin of the loop, indicating that OXA-10 was able to accommodate structural elements originating from rather close (e.g., OXA-48) but also very
distant proteins (e.g., OXA-23 and OXA-24). To better analyze the
differences in the biochemical properties of wild-type OXA-10 and
the loop variants, two of these variants (containing the most distant
heterologous loops; that is, from OXA-24 and OXA-48) were
puriﬁed to near homogeneity and subjected to kinetic analysis.
Similar catalytic efﬁciencies were obtained with the loop variants and the wild-type OXA-10 for the hydrolysis of ampicillin,
oxacillin, and cephalothin (Table 3), and only minor differences
could be observed in the kcat and Km values (up to 5- or 10-fold
variations, respectively). This ﬁnding conﬁrms the excellent plasticity of OXA-10, as the enzyme is not only tolerant to the substitution of its β5–β6 loop but also largely maintains its original
biochemical properties unaltered. This theory is further reinforced
by the comparison of the kinetic data of the OXA-10 loop variants
with that of the native carbapenemase. Indeed, OXA-24 is characterized by a very low turnover rate of oxacillin, and a very large
Km value for this substrate (Table 3), but such a typical behavior is
not observed with the OXA-10loop24 variant. These results thus
indicate that the residues constituting the β5–β6 loop of OXA-10
are not relevant for the hydrolysis of ampicillin, oxacillin, or
cephalothin. Most strikingly, kinetic analysis conﬁrmed the acquisition of a signiﬁcant carbapenem-hydrolyzing activity, essentially reﬂected by the impressive increase of the kcat value (up to
175-fold). An increase of the Km value is also observed in the loop
variants, which determines a signiﬁcant change in the behavior of
OXA-10 toward carbapenems. Indeed, the wild-type enzyme is
readily acylated (low Km and high kcat/Km values) but very slowly
deacylated (low turnover rates), imipenem being a poor substrate
(or inhibitor) of the enzyme. This process actually allowed for the
direct structural observation of the acylated imipenem or meropenem complex structures of OXA-13, an enzyme very close to
OXA-10 (12). In contrast, the loop variants now show kinetic
parameters for the hydrolysis of imipenem that are closer to that
measured with cephalothin. It is important to mention that the
turnover rates of these laboratory loop variants are actually higher

than those measured for the parent carbapenemases, being threeto ninefold greater than that of OXA-48 (the class D carbapenemase showing the highest turnover rate for imipenem) and OXA24, respectively (Table 3) (6, 7). This ﬁnding indicates that these
rationally designed mutants are actually more efﬁcient than the
natural enzymes, although it could not be excluded that the substitution of the loop might affect other factors, such as protein
stability and folding.
Structural Properties of the OXA-10 Loop Variants. Once we determined that the substitution of the β5–β6 loop of OXA-10 could
yield laboratory variants with signiﬁcant carbapenem-hydrolyzing
activity, two questions needed to be addressed from the structural
standpoint: (i) What would be the conformation adopted by the
grafted carbapenemase loop? (ii) What would be the impact of
the replacement of the β5–β6 loop of OXA-10 on its overall fold
and the active site properties?
Crystals of the puriﬁed loop variants (OXA-10loop24 and OXA10loop48) were readily obtained, although both proteins crystalDe Luca et al.

lized in different conditions, likely reﬂecting the different nature
and composition of the grafted loop. In addition, these two variants
crystallized in different space groups and with signiﬁcantly different
cell dimensions and content (Table 4). Both OXA-10loop24 and
OXA-10loop48 variants adopted the dimeric quaternary structure
of wild-type OXA-10 (10, 11). Comparison of the overall fold of the
OXA-10 loop variants with that of the wild-type enzyme did not
reveal any signiﬁcant differences, except in the region of the β5–β6
loop (Fig. 2). Minor differences were observed in the extremities of
strands β5 and β6, reﬂecting the introduction of a shorter loop
connecting these two structural elements. A comparison of the
OXA-10 loop variants with OXA-24 (Fig. 2A) and OXA-48 (Fig.
2B) clearly indicates that the loops originating from carbapenemase
enzymes and grafted in OXA-10 at structurally equivalent positions
maintain the conformation presented on their respective wild-type
carbapenemases, and are oriented inward toward the active site.
This observation shows that the conformation of the loop is
maintained despite the important sequence heterogeneity, reinforcing the idea that such conformation is determined by the loop
length but also by the presence of a conserved PxxG motif, which is
found in the carboxyl-terminal part of the β5–β6 loop (residues
217–220 in the OXA-48 numbering). Indeed, by comparing all of
the available class D β-lactamase amino acid sequences (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), it emerged that this motif appears in all of
the enzymes with carbapenemase properties, but never occurs in
other OXA-type enzymes.
Concluding Remarks. β-Lactamases provided Bacteria with an ex-

traordinarily versatile tool that contributed and still contributes
to the development of resistance to successive generations of
β-lactam antibiotics. Considering the worldwide dissemination of
bacterial isolates exhibiting resistance to most available antibacterial drugs, the development of new β-lactamase inhibitors would
be desirable. From this perspective, the understanding of the
structure-function dependencies of clinically-relevant β-lactamases, like the class D carbapenemases investigated here, is of
primary importance.
In this work, we successfully evolved a narrow-spectrum class D
β-lactamase into a carbapenemase using a rational structure-based
approach. The hydrolytic properties of OXA-10–engineered laboratory variants, in which the β5–β6 loop found in various clinically
relevant class D carbapenemases (OXA-23, OXA-24, and OXA48) was inserted in the structurally equivalent position in OXA-10,
were signiﬁcantly altered as these variants acquired signiﬁcant
imipenem-hydrolyzing activity. The data presented here clearly
demonstrate the critical role of the residues of the β5–β6 loop in
determining the behavior of the enzyme toward carbapenem
substrates, although not in affecting its ability to hydrolyze other
substrates (like penicillins or cephalosporins). Interestingly, this
ﬁnding should be paralleled with the distinctive transconformation
shown by carbapenem compounds (Fig. 3), whose hydroxyethyl
moiety is located on the α-face of the β-lactam ring and is interacting with the side chains of residues in the β5–β6 loop.
Beyond their clinical relevance, β-lactamases also represent interesting model enzymes to investigate protein structure function
and molecular evolution (15, 16). From an evolutionary standpoint,
modiﬁcations of the loops close to the enzyme active site, which
could possibly arise from homologous recombination events, have
been recognized as a factor contributing to the evolution or diversiﬁcation of enzyme function within a family of structurally related proteins (16). The data presented here are in agreement with
such a model and represent an additional example of the structural
plasticity exhibited by a β-lactamase, in this case the class D enzyme
OXA-10. Indeed, this protein tolerated the substitution of an entire
active site loop connecting two conserved secondary structures
without signiﬁcantly altering its tertiary structure. Moreover, this
substitution was speciﬁcally responsible for a dramatic broadening
of the enzyme substrate proﬁle, now including carbapenems, without determining a trade-off of the enzyme original properties, thus
further highlighting the importance of active site loops in the
functional properties of class D β-lactamases.

laboratory variants with the engineered
β5–β6 loop. The residues of the β5–β6 loop
in these laboratory variants are shown
as sticks, and the corresponding 2Fc-Fo

in Fig. 1A. (A) Stereoview of the superimposed structures of OXA-10 (gray), its
β5–β6 loop laboratory variant OXA10loop24 (purple), and OXA-24 (yellow).
The tertiary structure of the OXA10loop24 variant is similar to that of the
native OXA-10, except in the region of
the β5–β6 loop, which now adopts a conformation very similar to that observed in
the enzyme from which it originates
(OXA-24). (B) Stereoview of the superimposed structures of OXA-10 (gray), its β5–β
6 loop laboratory variant OXA-10loop48
(green), and OXA-48 (blue). Similarly to
the OXA-10loop24 variant, the tertiary
structure of the OXA-10loop48 variant is
similar to that of the native OXA-10, except in the region of the β5–β6 loop,
which also adopts the peculiar conformation observed in OXA-48.

Finally, this work also represents an interesting example of rational in vitro evolution of a protein substrate proﬁle, following
a molecular dynamics study that provided relevant information to
hypothesize a catalytic mechanism (i.e., the role of the β5–β6 loop
in promoting the rotation of the 6α-hydroxyethyl moiety of the
acylated substrate, allowing for the correct activation of the
deacylation water molecule) (7), which is now clearly supported by
experimental data. Moreover, this mechanism seems to be adopted by all three class D carbapenemases investigated in this study
and might well extend to other class D enzymes with similar
properties (e.g., the acquired OXA-58 enzyme), thus providing
previously unexplored insights potentially useful for the design of
new β-lactamase inhibitors.

0.5) to a 10 μg/mL (3.3 μM) imipenem solution and incubated at 30 °C for at
least 4 h. Ten-microliter aliquots of the antibiotic solution were spotted
down every hour onto a seeded top agar lawn of B. subtilis ATCC6633 on
Mueller-Hinton plate (supplemented with colistin 2 μg/mL to prevent the
growth of the E. coli strain). The diameter of the growth inhibition zone was
measured after an incubation for 18 h at 37 °C.
Protein Production and Puriﬁcation. OXA-10 and its variants were produced
from 1-L cultures of E. coli DH5α carrying plasmid pLBII-OXA10 or pLBIIOXA10loop24, and from culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying plasmid pET24-OXA10 loop48 in ZYP-5052 medium (21) at 30 °C for 24 h (for OXA-10 and
OXA-10loop48) and 48 h (for OXA-10loop24). Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), resuspended, and lysed by sonication.
Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 40 min, 4 °C). The
proteins were puriﬁed in two or three chromatography steps. The ﬁrst step
was a cation exchange on a Hi-Trap SP-High Performance (prepacked col-

Molecular Techniques. An OXA-10-producing E. coli laboratory strain was
obtained following PCR ampliﬁcation of the blaOXA-10 ORF with speciﬁc primers
(Table 5) with the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Biochemicals), as
previously described (17). The reaction conditions used were the following: an
initial denaturation step at 96 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for
1 min, annealing at 48 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 1 min and 30 s, and
a ﬁnal extension step at 72 °C for 20 min. The 760-bp ampliﬁcation product was
subcloned in the EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites of pLB-II vector (18), to obtain
the pLBII-OXA-10 plasmid. The OXA-10 laboratory variants were constructed by
overlapping PCR with partially overlapping primers (Table 5), as previously
described (19), using the pLBII-OXA10 plasmid as the template. The resulting
mutated β-lactamase genes were sequenced to conﬁrm the absence of any
unwanted mutations.
In Vitro Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing and Evaluation of Carbapenemase
Activity in the Bacterial Host. The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli
DH5α carrying pLBII-OXA10 and other vectors was determined by the
microdilution broth method, as recommended by the Clinical Laboratory
Standards Institute (20), using supplemented Mueller-Hinton broth (Difco
Laboratories) with an inoculum size of 104 CFU per well. Results were
recorded after 18 h of incubation at 37 °C.

umn GE Healthcare) for both wild-type and mutants at pH 6.0 and pH 7.5,
respectively; the second step was for the wild-type anion exchange (performed with a Mono Q, pH 7.6) and for the mutant cation exchange (performed with a Mono S, pH 7.5). Protein elution was performed using a linear
gradient of K2SO4 (up to 0.5 M) instead of NaCl, to prevent inhibition of the
enzyme by chloride ions. When required, the β-lactam–containing fractions
were pooled and loaded on a XK 16/70 column packed with 120 mL of
Superdex75 prep grade gel (GE Healthcare) using buffer with 20 mM Tris
H2SO4 plus 0.3 M K2SO4, which was also used for protein elution (10).

substrates of puriﬁed OXA-10 and the variants thereof were determined at
30 °C in using buffer with 20 mM Tris H2SO4 plus 0.3 M K2SO4 (10) supplemented with Na2CO3 50 mM using a Cary 100 UV-visible light spectrophotometer (Varian), as previously described (17). The enzyme concentration in
the various assays ranged 1 to 500 nM.
Crystallization, X-Ray Diffraction, and Model Reﬁnement. Crystals of OXA-10
variants (OXA-10loop24 and OXA-10loop48) were obtained in a sitting-drop
set-up (24-well Cryschem microplates; Hampton Research) in the following
conditions: 0.1 M Tris pH 8.0, 2.8 M (NH4)2SO4 or 0.1 M Bicine pH 9.0, 2.9 M
(NH4)2SO4, for OXA-10loop24 and OXA-10loop48, respectively. The drop
consisted of 2 μL of 10 mg/mL of protein and 2 μL of the precipitant solution.
Single crystals of β-lactamase were observed after several days of incubation at
room temperature. Diffraction data were collected on the ID14-1 and ID23-2
beamlines at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble,
France, at 100 K on crystals cryoprotected by 20% to 30% glycerol added to the
respective crystallization solutions. The data were processed using the program MOSFLM and scaled using the program SCALA (23). The data collection
parameters and data reduction statistics are reported in Table 4. The structure
of the OXA-10 variants was solved by molecular replacement using standard
Patterson search techniques, as implemented in the software MOLREP (24).
The structure of the wild-type OXA-10 (PDB code, 1K4F) with all water molecules and ions omitted was used as the search model. The reﬁnement was
carried out by using REFMAC5 (25). Between the reﬁnement cycles, the model
was subjected to manual rebuild using COOT (26). The same program was used
to model the various ligands (sulfate and ethylene glycol). Water molecules
were added by using the standard procedure within the ARP/wARP suite (27)
and checked by visual inspection. The stereochemical quality of both reﬁned
models was assessed using the program PROCHECK (28). Figures were made
using softwares PyMol (http://www.pymol.org/) or CCP4mg (29). The coordinates and structure factors of OXA-10loop24 and OXA-10loop48 have been
deposited at the Protein Data Bank under codes 3QNB and 3QNC, respectively.

Protein Analysis Techniques and Enzyme Kinetics. The presence of β-lactamase
in crude cell extracts and during all of the puriﬁcation steps was assayed
spectrophotometrically by monitoring the hydrolysis of 1 mM ampicillin at
235 nM. Enzyme purity and authenticity were assayed by SDS-PAGE and
peptide mass ﬁngerprint MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (following proteins
digestion by trypsin) (22). Kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of β-lactam
