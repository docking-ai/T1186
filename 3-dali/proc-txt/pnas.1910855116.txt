Signal detection and integration by sensory proteins constitute the
critical molecular events as living organisms respond to changes in a
complex environment. Many sensory proteins adopt a modular
architecture that integrates the perception of distinct chemical or
physical signals and the generation of a biological response in the
same protein molecule. Currently, how signal perception and
integration are achieved in such a modular, often dimeric, framework remains elusive. Here, we report a dynamic crystallography
study on the tandem sensor domains of a dual-sensor histidine
kinase PPHK (phosphorylation-responsive photosensitive histidine kinase) that operates a molecular logic OR, by which the output
kinase activity is modulated by a phosphorylation signal and a light
signal. A joint analysis of ∼170 crystallographic datasets probing
different signaling states shows remarkable dimer asymmetry as
PPHK responds to the input signals and transitions from one state
to the other. Supported by mutational data and structural analysis,
these direct observations reveal the working mechanics of the molecular logic OR in PPHK, where the light-induced bending of a long
signaling helix at the dimer interface is counteracted by the ligandinduced structural changes from a different sensor domain. We propose that the logic OR of PPHK, together with an upstream photoreceptor, implements a “long-pass” red light response distinct from
those accomplished by classical phytochromes.

The output kinase activity of PPHK clearly responds to both BeF−3
and light signals. In the absence of BeF−3 , PPHK displays significantly
higher kinase activity under red light (resulting in the Pg state) than
under green light (resulting in the Pr state) (Fig. 1 B and C). In the
presence of BeF−3 , however, the kinase activity is no longer lightdependent, although PPHK remains photoactive (Fig. 1B and SI
Appendix, Fig. S2). In a negative control experiment, we made a single
mutant, D59A, to disrupt the phosphorylation site, Asp59, which
indeed abolishes the BeF−3 sensitivity and restores light-dependent
responses in PPHK. Taken together, we demonstrate that PPHK is
a dual-sensor histidine kinase regulated by both a chemical signal
(phosphorylation) and a physical signal (light). If the output kinase
activity is represented by the binary states 0 and 1 for low and high,
respectively, PPHK accomplishes the logic OR gate (Fig. 1D).
In this work, we apply static and dynamic crystallography to investigate how the logic OR operation is achieved in this dualsensor histidine kinase. We have determined the crystal structure
of the tandem sensor domains of PPHK, which displays remarkable
dimer asymmetry. We present a wealth of structural, biochemical,
and mutational data to establish a mechanistic model that links the
local and global structural changes to the kinase activation of the
output domain. We show that the molecular logic is achieved in
PPHK when phosphorylation-induced structural changes in one
sensor domain counteract the light-induced allosteric effects from
the other sensor domain in the helical spine.

he ability to sense and integrate multiple environmental signals is critical for survival and adaptation of living organisms.
At the molecular level, many modular signaling proteins, including
photoreceptors and transmembrane chemoreceptors, are able to
integrate signal perception and enzymatic response in the same
protein framework (1–5). Yet, the underlying molecular mechanisms of allosteric regulation remain largely unknown. To study the
molecular mechanism of signal integration in modular systems,
we characterized a multidomain sensory histidine kinase from
cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya sp. JSC-1 (6, 7), denoted PPHK
(phosphorylation-responsive photosensitive histidine kinase).
PPHK features 2 distinct sensor domains, where the N-terminal
receiver (nREC) domain perceives a phosphorylation signal and
the second bilin-binding GAF domain senses a light signal (Fig. 1A
and SI Appendix, Fig. S1). As a photoreceptor, PPHK belongs to
the phytochrome superfamily and undergoes reversible photoconversion between the green light-absorbing (Pg) state and the
red light-absorbing (Pr) state (8, 9). The domain architecture of
PPHK is highly representative of the sensory histidine kinase superfamily, including transmembrane chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors (10) (Fig. 1A). Therefore, PPHK offers an excellent
model system for structural dissection of the allosteric action in
modular signaling proteins, where signals perceived by individual
sensor domains are integrated to make coherent decisions (1, 3, 4).
To interrogate the signaling logic of PPHK, we carried out
PhosTag-based histidine kinase assays in 4 different input conditions (Fig. 1B). Specifically, we used beryllofluoride ðBeF−3 Þ, a
compound widely used for mimicking phosphorylation of the Asp
residue, to introduce an input signal to the nREC domain (11–13).

Living organisms depend on sensory systems to monitor
changes in their surroundings and internal conditions. The
physical and chemical signals detected by various sensory proteins must be properly processed and modulated in order to
trigger prompt, precise, and coherent cellular responses. It is still
puzzling at the molecular level how these input signals are
perceived, transduced, and integrated into a finite number of
signaling pathways inside the cells without information loss.
Using dynamic crystallography and biochemistry, this work dissects the inner workings of a dual-sensor signaling protein that
accomplishes a molecular logic OR in response to 2 distinct input
signals. Findings provide structural insights into the operating
mechanism of signal integration in modular signaling proteins.

GAF framework (Fig. 2B and SI Appendix, Fig. S3). These long
linker helices display distinct local curvatures covarying along the
helical spine, where the juxtaposed helical segments adjust to
complement each other’s curvature (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A).
Specifically, the linker helix in subunit B features one major bend
near the middle, while its counterpart undulates twice, once in
each sensor domain. The dimer asymmetry is further evident in
the intersubunit joints, where the β4/β5 hairpin from the GAF
core directly interacts with His154 from the C terminus of GAFα1
in the partner subunit (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Fig. S4B). In contrast to an extended loop conformation in subunit A, the GAFα1/
α2 loop in B (denoted αB) is contracted, where Thr156 and
Leu157 swap the side-chain dispositions relative to the β-hairpin of A
(denoted βA) (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Fig. S4B). Both joints
(denoted βA/αB joint and βB/αA joint, respectively) engage close
Van der Waals (VDW) interactions with GAFα3, which constitutes
a T-junction motif consisting of 3 key structural elements: β-hairpin,
GAFα1/α2, and GAFα3 (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Figs. S4B and
S5). Remarkably, many crystal structures of the GAF sensors also
feature such a T-junction motif despite the distinct nature of their
input signals (15–17) (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). We postulate that this
conserved T-junction is important for signal coupling from the GAF
core domain to the helical spine. Helix parameterization also

Results
Crystal Structure of PPHK Reveals Remarkable Dimer Asymmetry.

The crystal structure of the 2 tandem sensor domains in PPHK
(denoted PPHK-TSD) was determined at 1.95 Å resolution (ref.
14, Fig. 2A, and SI Appendix, Fig. S1 and Table S1). In comparison
to the full-length protein, this truncated PPHK construct undergoes similar Pg/Pr photoconversion but renders a more stable
Pr state (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 A and B). Single-crystal spectroscopy
shows that PPHK-TSD is able to undergo Pg→Pr photoconversion
in the crystalline state, although the extent of photolysis is much
less compared with those in solution and the absorption spectrum
of the Pg state is slightly blue-shifted in crystals (SI Appendix, Fig.
S2C). PPHK forms a head-to-head parallel dimer, where the
nREC and bilin-binding GAF domains juxtapose along a central
helical spine at the dimer interface (Fig. 2A). The phycocyanobilin
chromophore is covalently attached to Cys241 in the GAF domain
and adopts the 15Ea configuration in the Pg state, confirmed by
acid denaturation experiments (Figs. 2A and 3A and SI Appendix,
Fig. S2B). The tandem sensor domains have minimal direct contacts with one another in contrast to the extensive dimer interface
(buried surface area of 1,770 Å2), with long tethered linker helices
spanning both domains. Two distinct sensory sites, namely, the
phosphorylation site Asp59 in the nREC domain and the bilin
chromophore in the GAF domain, are separated by ∼60 Å (SI
Appendix, Fig. S1B).
The PPHK structure shows remarkable dimer asymmetry
evidenced by an angular displacement of ∼22° between the linker

subunit, the nREC (light blue) and GAF (blue) domains are connected via a long
linker helix at the dimer interface. The phosphorylation site in the nREC domain is

with an Mg2+ ion in coordination with 3 water molecules (red sphere). The bilin
chromophore (in cyan) embedded in the GAF domain is covalently attached to
Cys241 (green). (B) Dimer asymmetry between subunits A (blue) and B (yellow) is
evident in the diverging linker helices when the 2 monomer structures are aligned
according to the GAF domain. (C) Bottom view of the PPHK dimer (indicated by a
gray block arrow) illustrates the spatial organization of the GAFα1/α2/α3 helices at
the dimer interface. Shaded red triangles highlight a unique feature, denoted
“β-tear,” between strands β1 and β5 of the β-sheet in the GAF domain. The β4/
β5 hairpin from one subunit is closely associated with the GAFα1/α2 turn from the
partner subunit. The equivalent intersubunit distances (dashed red lines) show
that such intersubunit contacts are not symmetrical, and the βA/αB joint renders
shorter distances, and thus tighter interactions, than the βB/αA joint.

reveals a shorter helical pitch in the nRECα5 segment of the linker
helix in subunit B (SI Appendix, Fig. S6A). As the contracted βA/αB
joint presses on GAFα1B on the other end, the linker helix in B is
likely to endure compression at both ends, resulting in a large bend
in the middle (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A). As shown later in this paper,
perturbations to the T-junction by an input signal or mutation alter
the dimer asymmetry, thereby affecting the kinase activity of PPHK.
The Chromophore Undergoes Light-Induced “Flip-and-Rotate” Motions.

To capture light-induced structural changes in the Pg→Pr pathway,
we conducted temperature-scan (T-scan) experiments on photoactive
PPHK-TSD crystals, where the Pg state serves as the reference or
parent state (18) (SI Appendix, Fig. S7A). By collecting the light
(denoted Fgreen) and reference (denoted Fred) datasets from the
same crystal or from a pair of crystals, we calculated Fgreen/Fred
difference maps to examine light-induced structural changes initiated
at different temperatures ranging from 100 K to room temperature
(RT; at 293 K) (Fig. 3C and SI Appendix, Figs. S7 and S8). Here, light
and temperature are exploited as experimental variables to provoke
and trap light-induced structural events along the reaction pathway.
To resolve possible structural heterogeneity, we applied singular value
decomposition (SVD) to a collection of difference maps or simulatedannealed omit maps (19) (Fig. 3B and SI Appendix, Fig. S10).
Remarkable difference signals appear in the Fgreen/Fred difference Fourier maps starting at 150 K, corresponding to flipping of

ring D resulting from 15E→15Z photoisomerization about the
C15 = C16 double bond of the bilin chromophore (Fig. 3). These
signals are barely detectable at temperatures below 140 K, but quite
prominent at 160 to 180 K before they spread to ring C. Between
180 to 200 K, the difference densities also appear in the helical
spine, where strong difference signals propagate from the GAF
domain to the nREC domain as the temperature rises (SI Appendix,
Fig. S8). At RT, the entire chromophore is displaced with a clear
overall rotation (Fig. 3 A and C and SI Appendix, Fig. S9A). The
“flip-and-rotate” motions are evident in the top-ranked components in the SVD analysis of a collection of 224 difference maps
masked around the chromophore (Fig. 3B and SI Appendix, Fig.
S10). Therefore, they represent the most significant and distinct
light-induced structural events. Based on their temperature dependence, we infer that the flip of ring D precedes the chromophore
rotation in the Pg→Pr photoreaction pathway (SI Appendix, Fig. S11).
It is noteworthy that the chromophore rotation signals are mostly
found in subunit B, but not subunit A (Fig. 3 and SI Appendix, Fig.
S10). We speculate that dimer asymmetry also contributes to kinetic
trapping of the otherwise elusive intermediates, along with
cryotemperatures and the crystal lattice (SI Appendix, Fig. S11).
These crystallographic observations suggest that the “flip-androtate” model represents a common light signaling mechanism in
both classical phytochromes and cyanobacteriochromes (20–22).

the Pg and Pr structures. First, the linker helix in subunit B bends
even further in the Pr state, resulting in a more asymmetrical
helical spine (Fig. 4A and Movie S1). Second, 2 GAF domains
undergo a small rotation relative to the helical spine but in the
opposite directions, resulting in greater asymmetry between the
intersubunit βA/αB and βB/αA joints (Fig. 4 B and C).

Phosphorylation of Asp59 Counteracts Light-Induced Structural Changes.

To address signal integration, we probed the phosphorylationinduced signals by soaking the PPHK-TSD crystals in a crystallization buffer containing BeF−3 (SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2).
We determined the BeF−3 -bound PPHK structure at 2.44 Å resolution ref. 26 and (Fig. 5A). Upon BeF−3 binding, the side chain of
Tyr60 moves away from Asp59 to accommodate BeF−3 , which is
further stabilized by a highly conserved Thr89 (Fig. 5A). Concomitantly, the nRECβ4/α4 loop undergoes major rearrangements
as the backbone structure is displaced by as much as 4.8 Å;
meanwhile, the bulky Tyr108 retreats from the dimer interface to
fill a space vacated by Thr89. We must point out that although
both phosphorylation sites are accessible in the crystal lattice, only
subunit A undergoes large protein structural changes, with strong
BeF−3 -binding signals at the phosphorylation site in comparison to
subunit B (SI Appendix, Fig. S14). The BeF−3 binding was only detectable in B at a much higher concentration of BeF−3 . Such asymmetrical responses to a phosphorylation signal are also manifested in
the top-ranked SVD components when >300 simulated-annealing
omit maps around the phosphorylation site were jointly analyzed
(SI Appendix, Fig. S14A).
In the absence of BeF−3 , nRECα4 is overwound by an additional
∼4° per residue compared with nRECα5 (SI Appendix, Fig. S6C).
This helical overwinding arises from a tight nRECβ4/α4 turn stabilized by short hydrogen bonds involving Thr89. Upon BeF−3
binding, Thr89 moves toward BeF−3 as the nRECβ4/α4 turn is
transformed to an extended loop forming new hydrogen bonds
with Tyr108 relocated between nRECα4 and β5 (Fig. 5A). As the
relaxed nRECα4A tilts toward the dimer interface, it inevitably

BIOPHYSICS AND
COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY

To examine what leads to these global structural changes, we
discovered a remarkable structure feature in the central β-sheet
conserved among the bilin-binding GAF proteins. Each of the
β2 and β5 strands contains an extra residue, giving rise to an irregular hydrogen-bonding pattern in the core β-sheet, with a
typical 2-1-5-4-3 topology (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). As these
creased β-strands are directed toward different directions, the
β-sheet seems to be torn between the β1 and β5 strands, resulting
in a β-tear that is spatially flanked by 2 sets of highly conserved
residues, namely, LWG in β5 and YR/KF in β1 (Fig. 2C and SI
Appendix, Fig. S12D). On one side is the T-junction, where the
β4/β5 hairpin directly interacts with the helical spine (SI Appendix,
Figs. S4B and S12D). On the other side is the YR/KF motif, where
Tyr182 is adjacent to ring D of the chromophore (SI Appendix,
Fig. S9B). In the Pr structure, this β-tear further develops in
subunit B, while joining up in subunit A (SI Appendix, Fig. S13).
We postulate that the β-tear, together with the T-junction,
bridges the chromophore activity to the helical spine, which directly accounts for further bending of the helical spine in response to green light (SI Appendix, Fig. S9C). On one hand, the
rigid βA/αB joint exerts a shear force on the β-tear in subunit A,
resulting in a tense protein pocket that apparently hinders the
chromophore rotation (SI Appendix, Fig. S9B). On the other
hand, the restricted chromophore relaxation following 15E/15Z
photoisomerization in subunit A would apply a counterforce on
GAFα1B, which compresses the βA/αB joint, thus further
deforming the linker helix (Fig. 4A). This conserved T-junction
structure thereby converts a local signal into a global signal
without large-amplitude motions.

OUTPUT

Mechanism of Signal Integration. In the PPHK structure, the long
linker helices at the dimer interface are asymmetrically tethered in
a left-handed manner (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A). This twisted helical
spine is likely to predicate different structural responses between
the 2 chemically identical subunits, as observed by dynamic crystallography (Fig. 6). Each sensor domain in this modular architecture employs a unique coupling mechanism to trigger the global
structural responses (Fig. 6 and SI Appendix, Fig. S15). We propose
that the GAF sensor module uses the T-junction structure to
bridge the light-induced photoisomerization to the helical spine,
while the nREC domain relays a phosphorylation signal to the
dimer interface via the Thr89/Tyr108 coupling (Fig. 5A). It is the
collective allosteric action of all input signals on the helical spine
that governs the outcome in the effector histidine kinase domain
(Fig. 6). In this work, we show that the light-induced effect is
overridden by BeF−3 -induced tilting of nRECα4A at the dimer interface (Fig. 5 B and C). In other words, nRECα4A acts as a limit
switch that counteracts the light responses in the helical spine. As a
result, the molecular logic OR gate is achieved in PPHK.
To test this model, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis at
several key positions in full-length PPHK (Fig. 7). We made a single
mutant Y108A to examine the role of Tyr108 in the nREC domain
(Fig. 7 A and B). Y108A does not affect the Pg/Pr photoconversion
(Fig. 7D), but this single mutation abrogates the BeF−3 -induced
response in PPHK and significantly weakens the light dependence
of the kinase activity (Fig. 7E). We also note that the indole ring of
Trp266 in the highly conserved LWG motif engages close VDW
interactions with a hydrophobic residue (Leu299) in GAFα3 of the
GAF domain (Fig. 4C). We made 2 single mutations at this position, W266A and W266L. W266L seems to be stuck in the Pg state,
while W266A is still photoactive (Fig. 7D). As a result, the kinase
activity of W266L is no longer light-dependent and constitutively
high (Fig. 7E).
To examine the role of the T-junction, we made a single mutant
H154A to disrupt the intersubunit joints between the β4/β5 hairpin
and GAFα1 (Fig. 7C). Remarkably, H154A completely abolishes the
kinase activity of PPHK in the absence of BeF−3 . Adding BeF−3 to the
reaction mix partially recovers the histidine kinase activity (Fig. 7E).
Not surprisingly, the photoactivity of PPHK is minimally affected by
H154A since His154 is located far away (>30 Å) from the chromophore pocket (Fig. 7D). We postulate that the His154→Ala
substitution makes the intersubunit βA/αB and βB/αA joints more
asymmetrical, given the twisted or coiled helical spine (Fig. 4). The
βA/αB joint on one side of the dimer engages closer backbone interactions, while the βB/αA joint loosens up on the other side. The
helical spine is further bent to such an extent that the histidine kinase
activity is no longer detectable.
Taken together, we advance a model to elucidate how PPHK
operates the molecular logic “OR” gate in response to 2 distinct
input signals: here, a phosphorylation signal and a light signal. In a
modular architecture, long linker helices at the dimer interface are
tethered to form a helical spine, to which distinct sensor (input) and
effector (output) domains are attached (Fig. 6). Given the minimal
contacts between the modular domains, such helical tethering leads
to the dimer asymmetry across the dimer interface and the state
asymmetry (the R vs. T state) between the adjacent domains. The

Dimer Asymmetry

INPUT1 + INPUT2

hinders the motion of nRECα5B, thereby preventing further
bending of the linker helix in subunit B (Fig. 5B). Meanwhile,
nRECα5A is further separated from nRECα4A by the retracted
bulky side chain of Tyr108, as evidenced by an increase of ∼10° in
their interhelix angle (SI Appendix, Fig. S4C). Collectively, these
BeF−3 -induced motions convert a local phosphorylation signal into
the global structural changes that directly conflict with the lightinduced allosteric effects (Fig. 5B). Given the conservation of the
Thr89/Tyr108 coupling, these results also shed light on the general
signaling mechanism of response regulators (27).

Fig. 6. Signal integration in modular signaling proteins. PPHK features a
typical “beans-on-the-stalk” architecture, where the sensor (input) and effector (output) domains are attached to a helical spine, where long linker
helices (cylinders) are tethered at the dimer interface. The helical tethering
may result in 2 kinds of asymmetry (marked by double-headed arrows): the
dimer asymmetry across the dimer interface and the state asymmetry (the R
vs. T state) between the adjacent domains. The sensor and effector domains
are often separated by lipid bilayers in transmembrane receptors that share
similar architectures. The purple arrow and red 3-way arrows represent the
“molecular levers” in PPHK that facilitate the signal coupling from each
sensory site to the helical spine, where global structural changes are reconciled via concerted helical bending, unwinding, and/or compression. The
helical spine thus functions as a signaling hub, where various input signals
are integrated to affect the same effector domain in the same protein
framework. HK, histidine kinase; P, phosphorylation signal.

resulting twisted helical spine acts as a signaling hub. This hub takes
an input as an individual sensor domain tweaks or deforms the
helical spine. As global protein structural changes are reconciled via
helical bending, unwinding, and/or compression (Fig. 5 and SI
Appendix, Fig. S6), different input signals are integrated in the
shared spine to ultimately alter the same effector domain. Similar
scaffolds are found in the transmembrane receptors, where the
sensor and effector domains are separated by lipid bilayers (Fig. 6).
PPHK thus offers a prototype for studying how modular signaling
proteins make autonomous decisions within the same molecule.

To understand what in vivo function would be gained by PPHK,
we examined its genome neighborhood in JSC-1, and found a
Cph1-like phytochrome gene immediately upstream of PPHK (SI
Appendix, Fig. S16). We speculate that the nREC domain of PPHK
receives a phosphoryl group from this upstream protein, which
features 3 N-terminal photosensory domains (namely, PAS, GAF,
and PHY) typical of classical phytochromes conferring the photoconversion between the red-light–absorbing (Pr) state and far-redlight–absorbing (Pfr) state (8). We and others have shown that the
output histidine kinase is more active in the Pr state than the Pfr
state in bacterial phytochromes (18, 28, 29). Upon far-red light, this
upstream phytochrome is likely to form the Pr state, resulting in
higher histidine kinase activity that promotes the nREC phosphorylation in PPHK. Upon red light, formation of the Pfr state in
the upstream phytochrome would reduce the nREC phosphorylation, while PPHK forms the Pg state. Given the molecular logic OR
(Fig. 1), we postulate that the dual-sensor PPHK works in tandem
with the upstream phytochrome to implement a “long-pass” photoreceptor, where the output kinase activity is promoted by both

that rendered by a canonical phytochrome, which is activated by
far-red light and deactivated by red light (SI Appendix, Fig. S16).
Discussion
Structural Asymmetry. Structural asymmetry has been an emerg-

ing theme among signaling proteins, where individual domains of
distinct function are connected by long helices (17, 30–32). Such
asymmetry is distinct from noncrystallography symmetry or the
structural variations due to crystal packing. While the former
concerns structural differences in the core regions and interfaces,
the latter primarily arises from thermal fluctuation or flexibility
of the protein surface features. Despite the importance of structural asymmetry in enzyme regulation and signaling, the mechanistic understanding has been largely conceptual and lacking in
structural details due to technical difficulties in biophysical interrogation (32, 33). In this work, we apply dynamic crystallography to provoke, probe, and dissect the dimer asymmetry as PPHK
transitions from one signaling state to the other.

If the “relaxed” or R state denotes a protein conformation
prone to structural changes upon stimulation and the “tense” or
T state denotes the rigid counterpart, the nREC domains of
subunits A and B are thus assigned to the R and T states, respectively,
because subunit A allows more extensive protein structural changes
upon ligand binding. The state assignment, however, is reversed for
the GAF domain, where the “tense” protein framework in subunit A
apparently hinders the chromophore rotation. For the same reason,
strong local signals arising from ring D flipping have been observed in
subunit A due to kinetic trapping (Fig. 3C), in contrast to the “relaxed” protein framework in subunit B, which allows the chromophore rotation at RT (Fig. 3C and SI Appendix, Fig. S9A). Here,
PPHK features 2 distinct types of asymmetry: the dimer asymmetry between 2 chemically identical subunits as well as the state
asymmetry between adjacent domains in the same subunit (Fig. 6).
In the head-to-head dimer structure, these asymmetries are orthogonal but intertwined, thereby rendering distinct states via tethering.
It is noteworthy that dimer asymmetry is rarely seen in the
crystal structures of single-domain or shorter constructs (34–36)
but is often self-evident in the structures of multiple modular
domains (30, 32, 37), where the long flexible linker helices are
tethered in the shared scaffold. The α4/α5/α5 dimer interface
featured by the nREC domain is quite common among response
regulators (11, 27, 38), as is the 6-helix bundle for the GAF sensor
proteins (15, 17, 36, 38). In PPHK, the slightly deformed helical
spine likely results from simultaneous accommodation of these
conserved dimer interfaces (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A). Here, deformation of the helical spine arms PPHK like a mousetrap ready for
a trigger. Due to dimer asymmetry, each protomer may proceed
differently along the reaction trajectory (SI Appendix, Fig. S11).
GAF-A in the rigid T state seems to render deeper energy wells
such that the signals associated with ring D flipping are sufficiently
populated for trapping (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, GAF-B in
the R state allows the reaction to advance further along the
Pg→Pr pathway (Fig. 3C and SI Appendix, Fig. S10). Dimer
asymmetry ultimately alters the kinase activity as the helical spine
extends to the effector domain. Our PPHK data suggest that the
greater the dimer asymmetry in the tandem sensor domains, the
lower is the kinase activity. Similar phenomena observed in other
modular signaling proteins (30, 32, 37) suggest a tug-of-war in
dimer symmetry between the sensor and effector domains.
The Helical Spine as a Signaling Hub. A long linker helix of 40 residues is a recurring motif among modular signaling proteins. Such
a “signaling helix” often contains a heptad sequence, suggesting a
coiled-coil conformation (39). With a weak heptad pattern, the
linker helices in PPHK feature Glu and Gln directly involved in
helical tethering (SI Appendix, Fig. S15 B and C). Given the
spring-like mechanics of long helices, their juxtapositions at the
dimer interface would impose certain torsional strains on the helical spine. Strategic positioning of Gln300/301 at the staggered
junctions between the overlapping helices also suggests a role in
signal coupling between the sensor and effector domains (Fig. 6
and SI Appendix, Fig. S15B).
In a modular system, each input signal is entered into the signaling hub via a unique mechanism (10, 30). In PPHK, a phosphorylation signal is relayed to the helical spine via the Thr89/
Tyr108 coupling, and the GAF domain is likely to transduce a light
signal to the helical spine via the conserved T-junction (Fig. 6 and
SI Appendix, Fig. S15A). This T-junction motif is found in other
GAF proteins, including the classical phytochromes, oxygen sensor
proteins, and human phosphodiesterases despite their distinct nature of input signals (15–17, 40, 41) (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Although helical supercoiling has been proposed to account for the
light action in a chimeric blue-light photoreceptor, YF1 (30, 42), it
was not clear what light-induced structural events trigger such a
change in supercoiling, given the limited resolution afforded by
X-ray solution scattering. In YF1, Trp103 makes direct VDW con19980 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1910855116

tacts with the Jα-helix (Protein Data Bank ID code 4GCZ) (30, 43)
in a similar disposition of Trp266 in PPHK. Thus, the conserved
Trp103 may serve as a molecular lever in light signaling of the
LOV (light-oxygen-voltage) proteins. It is plausible that these
subtle local signals exerted by individual molecular levers are further integrated or amplified as the tethered helices adjust themselves via bending, compression, and winding in the signaling hub.
Motion, Force, and Structure Rigidity in Protein Mechanics. To dissect the inner workings of a signaling protein, it is important to
establish what structural events drive the next, and how various
forms of energy are introduced and released during signal
transduction. Such information can be derived from the time
sequence and/or temperature dependence of distinct reaction
intermediates (18, 44–47). Using the T-scan as an example, the
higher the temperature required to provoke a structural signal,
the more advanced is the corresponding event along the reaction
pathway (18, 48, 49). Our T-scan data on PPHK suggest that the
strain energy arising from the primary photoisomerization event
(140 to 170 K) drives the helical motions at the dimer interface
(180 to 190 K) before the chromophore is allowed to undergo
further relaxation with a rotational motion at 293 K (Fig. 3C and
SI Appendix, Fig. S8).
The forces that drive protein motions are difficult to measure
experimentally. However, they can be deduced from the changes
they effect. To this end, helix parameterization offers a very
useful tool for analyzing the nature and extent of helical distortion or deformation segment by segment. In a previous study,
we demonstrated that subtle changes in helical winding or torsion represent a critical event in rhodopsin signaling (50).
Changes in helical pitch, diameter, and interhelix angles inform
both the direction and amplitude of forces associated with the
strain energy stored in distorted or deformed helices (SI Appendix, Fig. S6).
In addition to motion and force, protein rigidity plays an important role in long-range signaling. A rigid structure would
sustain and transmit force without large displacements. In this
sense, the T state presents structural rigidity essential for lossless
signaling over a long distance, although it is less prone to changes
compared with the R state. In this work, we calculate the rootmean-square deviation distance matrix from a collection of
perturbed structures to identify rigid elements and/or close associations between different elements (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
Such rigid frameworks provide unbiased references for structural
alignment to reveal subtle changes that are otherwise concealed
by random variations from structure to structure (51). We posit
that protein motions, force, and structural rigidity are 3 integral
parts that constitute the working mechanics of a signaling
protein.
Dynamic Crystallography. Dynamic crystallography aims to provoke
and probe structural changes as a function of an experimental
variable, which could be time, temperature, ligand, or light conditions among others (18, 33, 52). However, the functional relevant structural changes are often so subtle in the crystal lattice that
they cannot be readily distinguished from thermal fluctuations.
We have shown that it is entirely possible to extract small signals
by joint analysis of a large dynamic crystallography dataset using
SVD (18, 19, 51). No matter how small the amplitudes, signals
shall be consistent and reproducible, and therefore self-evident, in
the SVD analysis. Furthermore, the scatter plots between the
SVD coefficient sets are highly informative for establishing the
origins and correlations of these signals (SI Appendix, Fig. S10B).
This work demonstrates that the crystal lattice, temperature,
and dimer asymmetry can be exploited by dynamic crystallography.
Generally speaking, a reaction initiated in crystals renders a
more rugged energy landscape compared with the same reaction in
solution (SI Appendix, Fig. S11). In addition, the reaction temperature

than a caveat, the lattice hindrance offers a kinetic trap for capturing
structural events otherwise too elusive or transient to detect by
solution-based methods.

and trapping temperature can be used to alter the rate constants
of a reaction, thereby providing a floodgate to populate certain
transient intermediates. As discussed before, the different reaction trajectories between protomers due to dimer asymmetry
offer additional means for capturing intermediates.
Protein crystals have an average solvent content of ∼50%. The
corresponding protein concentration in the crystal lattice (∼300
mg/mL) is comparable to the local macromolecular concentrations inside a bacterial cell (∼200 to 320 mg/mL). This suggests
that it is entirely possible to provoke functionally relevant
structure dynamics in crystals. However, large-amplitude structural changes, often associated with formation of the final
products, are less likely to occur in protein crystals due to lattice
constraints. In addition, the achievable extent of photolysis is rather
limited in a photoactive crystal due to its high optical density, which
impedes full light penetration. As a result, the structural changes
captured by dynamic crystallography may not fully represent protein
dynamics in solution. Nevertheless, these small-amplitude signals are
extremely informative from a mechanistic perspective because they
provide unparalleled insights into the nature and trend of the structural events leading up to a full development in solution. As shown in
this work, the ligand-induced and light-induced structural changes
allow us to examine the interplay between 2 distinct sensor domains
